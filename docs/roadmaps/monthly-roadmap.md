# CCNA 6-Month Lab Roadmap

This summary mirrors the reference study plan and points to the working folders under labs/.

## Month 01 - Network Foundations and Basic Tools (Fundamentals Part I)
**Focus:** Build a strong foundation in basic networking concepts and terminology. By the end of Month 1, you should understand how networks operate at a fundamental level (OSI and TCP/IP models, what routers and switches do, basics of IP addressing) and have your study/lab environment set up. We'll also start doing simple labs in Packet Tracer to cement concepts. Domains covered: Primarily Network Fundamentals (CCNA domain 1.0), plus basic hands-on skills.

## Month 02 - Network Access and Switching Essentials (Fundamentals Part III + Intro to Network Access)
**Focus:** Month 2 transitions from pure theory into more hands-on switching and network access topics. We'll cover the CCNA Network Access domain (VLANs, STP, EtherChannel, wireless LANs in more depth) and finish any remaining fundamentals (like ARP, DHCP basics) as they tie in. By the end of Month 2, you'll have configured VLANs, understood how switches prevent loops with STP, and set up a basic wireless LAN. We'll also continue practicing subnetting and introduce more troubleshooting and design thinking. Domains covered: Network Access (CCNA domain 2.0) in-depth, plus relevant IP Services basics (DHCP, ARP) and revisit Network Fundamentals concepts in practice.

## Month 03 - Routing & IP Connectivity (Core Routing Protocols and Services)
**Focus:** Month 3 dives into the IP Connectivity domain (25%) - configuring and understanding routing. We will cover static routing and the OSPF routing protocol in detail, as well as first-hop redundancy protocols conceptually. We'll integrate IP Services like DHCP, NAT, and NTP as we set up networks that need those services. By the end of Month 3, you will have built multi-router topologies, configured  19 dynamic routing with OSPF, and implemented common IP services in labs. Domains covered: Primarily IP Connectivity (CCNA 3.0) and parts of IP Services (CCNA 4.0) like DHCP, NTP as needed in labs.

## Month 04 - Security Fundamentals and Advanced Networking
**Focus:** Month 4 addresses the Security Fundamentals (15%) domain and ties up any leftover core topics. We will cover device security (passwords, AAA concepts), Layer 2 security (like port security, DHCP snooping) and wireless security. We'll also introduce some automation basics (to prep for Month 5) and do heavy review this month - mock tests and revisiting weak spots. By the end of Month 4, you should have touched all exam topics at least once. Domains covered: Security Fundamentals (CCNA 5.0) and parts of Automation/Programmability (basic intro). Plus ongoing review of earlier domains.

## Month 05 - Final Prep, Capstone Project, and Exam Readiness
**Focus:** Month 5 is about consolidation and application . We will integrate everything in a realistic capstone project , do last-mile prep with mock exams and flashcards, and finally take (and pass!) the CCNA exam likely in Week 4 or end of this month. Post-exam, we'll transition to job preparation tasks. (If you plan to take the exam in Month 6 instead, you can adjust accordingly, but this plan assumes by end of Month 5 you attempt the exam).

## Month 06 - Post-CCNA Career Preparation
**Focus:** With CCNA in hand, time to land that job! Month 6 (which might start immediately after passing or overlap if you took exam in Month 5) is devoted to job search prep: polishing resume, practicing interview questions (technical and HR), labbing any practical skills for interviews, and continuing to learn (perhaps start looking at CCNA specialization or CCNP topics lightly, to discuss future plans in interviews). We'll break it into 4 weeks with tasks, but you can adjust based on your situation (you might already be in a job and just need to leverage CCNA for promotion, etc.). We assume you're seeking a network engineer role or NOC/helpdesk that values CCNA.
