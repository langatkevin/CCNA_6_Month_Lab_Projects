6-Month CCNA 200-301 Study Plan for Aspiring
Network Engineers
Welcome  to  your  CCNA  journey!  This  comprehensive  6-month  plan  is  designed  for  a  complete
beginner to become a proficient network engineer and ace the Cisco CCNA 200-301 exam on the first
attempt . The plan balances theory, hands-on practice, and regular review, with ~10–15 hours per week
(roughly 2 hours/day for 5–6 days, allowing rest days ). Each month is divided into 4 weeks, each
with  clear  objectives,  curated  resources  (free  options  whenever  possible),  time  allocations,  and
checkpoints. We’ll cover all CCNA exam blueprint domains  – Network Fundamentals, Network Access,
IP Connectivity, IP Services, Security Fundamentals, Automation & Programmability –  and list every
subtopic  so nothing is missed. We’ll also integrate broader networking skills (troubleshooting, design,
Linux  basics,  Python  for  automation,  documentation)  to  shape  you  into  a  well-rounded  network
engineer .
Exam  Blueprint  Coverage: The  CCNA  200-301  exam  (120  minutes,  ~90–110  questions ,  passing
~825/1000)  covers  six  domains :  Network  Fundamentals  (20%) ,  Network  Access  (20%) ,  IP
Connectivity  (25%) ,  IP  Services  (10%) ,  Security  Fundamentals  (15%) ,  and  Automation  &
Programmability (10%) . Below is a full topic list for reference (you should be able to explain each
confidently by the end ):

(centralized control, speed, reduction of human error); Traditional networks vs controller-based
(Cisco DNA Center) networking ; Overlay, underlay, and fabric concepts; Separation of control
plane and data plane; Northbound vs southbound APIs ; Traditional device management
vs Cisco DNA Center approach ; REST API characteristics (CRUD operations, HTTP verbs, data
formats  like  JSON) ;  Config  management  tools  and  their  capabilities  (Puppet,  Chef,
Ansible) ; Interpret JSON data structures .
Tracking & Study Tools:  Throughout this plan, we’ll use tools to maximize learning: -
Note-taking & Organization:  Use a digital notebook (e.g. Notion  or OneNote). Create a
CCNA study hub to organize notes by topic and week, and track progress. One successful
CCNA passer said they “downloaded OneNote for free, and used it to make notes”  –
you can do the same with your preferred tool. We’ve included tips on documenting labs
and  making  a  “knowledge  base”  for  quick  review.  -  Flashcards  (Spaced  Repetition):
Leverage  Anki  (free on Windows/Mac) to drill important facts (protocol port numbers,
subnet masks, etc.). Many CCNA students create their own Anki decks ; Jeremy’s IT Lab
even provides flashcards to complement videos . We’ll prompt you when to create/
review flashcards. -  Lab Tools:  We’ll primarily use  Cisco Packet Tracer  (free network
simulator  –  sign  up  on  Cisco  NetAcad  to  download).  It’s  beginner-friendly  and
sufficient for CCNA labs (router/switch configs, STP, etc.). For variety or advanced practice,
you can also use  GNS3  or  EVE-NG  (free emulators) with real Cisco images, or Cisco’s
DevNet  Sandbox  for  hands-on  with  real  gear  (optional).  -  Practice  Exams/Quizzes:
Regular self-assessment is key. We recommend quality practice exams like Boson ExSim
(paid, high-fidelity CCNA exams) and free resources like  ExamTopics  (community CCNA
questions). We’ll schedule quizzes and a couple of full-length mock exams in Month 6. -
Time  Management  &  Wellness:  Consistency  beats  cramming.  Aim  for  ~2  hours  of
focused study on weekdays and a longer block on weekends.  Take 1–2 rest days per
week  to avoid burnout – use them for light review or simply recharge. Each week
ends with a milestone to keep you accountable. Consider scheduling your actual CCNA
exam date  toward the end of this plan – having a deadline can motivate you to stay on
track .2829

Let’s  dive  into  the  month-by-month  breakdown.  Each  month  has  a  theme  aligned  with  the  CCNA
domains and skill progression: - Months 1–2:  Core fundamentals – basic concepts, networking building
blocks, and getting comfortable with tools. - Months 3–4:  Intermediate configurations and protocols –
switching, routing, IP services in action. - Month 5:  Advanced topics – security and automation, tying
everything  together  in  integrated  labs.  -  Month  6:  Final  review  and  exam  prep  –  practice  tests,  a
capstone network project, and exam readiness. -  Post-CCNA (1 Month):  Career prep – polish your
resume, prepare for interviews, and plan next steps.
Throughout  the  plan,  keep  a  growth  mindset.  Mistakes  are  learning  opportunities  –  if  a  lab  or
concept is challenging, that’s normal! By steadily building knowledge and skills, you’ll gain confidence.
Now, let’s get started on Month 1.
Month 1: Network Foundations and Basic Tools (Fundamentals
Part I)
Focus:  Build a strong foundation in basic networking concepts and terminology. By the end of Month 1,
you should understand how networks operate at a fundamental level (OSI and TCP/IP models, what
routers and switches do, basics of IP addressing) and have your study/lab environment set up. We’ll also
start doing simple labs in Packet Tracer to cement concepts.  Domains covered:  Primarily  Network
Fundamentals  (CCNA domain 1.0), plus basic hands-on skills.
Week 1: Introduction to Networking & Lab Setup
Objectives (Week 1):
- Grasp the  basics of computer networks  – what networks are, client/server model, the Internet
structure, and common network terminology (LAN, WAN, bandwidth, latency).
- Learn about key  network components  and their roles:  routers, switches, firewalls, access points, end
devices (PCs, servers) . Be able to explain how each contributes to moving data.
-  Understand  the  OSI  7-layer  model  vs  TCP/IP  model ,  and  how  data  flows  through  the  layers
(encapsulation/de-encapsulation). Identify which layers correspond to which devices (e.g. switch = Layer
2, router = Layer 3).
- Set up your  lab environment : install Cisco Packet Tracer (or alternative) and familiarize with its
interface. Verify you can create a simple two-node network and ping between devices.
- Establish a note-taking and study routine: create a Notion page or notebook for Week 1 notes, and set
up Anki with a few starter flashcards (e.g. OSI layers, definitions of router/switch). 
Resources:
- Videos/Tutorials:
- “CCNA Zero-to-One: Intro to Networking”  (free YouTube, 20 min) – High-level introduction to what
networks are and the components involved (search “NetworkChuck what is a network”).
- Jeremy’s IT Lab Day 1 – Network Devices  (YouTube, ~30 min) – Covers different network device types
and where they operate . Jeremy’s IT Lab is a free comprehensive CCNA video course (we’ll use
many of his videos).
- Cisco Networking Academy Introduction  – If enrolled in Cisco NetAcad (free), complete Chapter 1:
Networking Today  from the Introduction to Networks v7  course (covers network components, topology
examples, etc.). This provides structured content and quizzes.
- (Optional) “OSI Model Explained”  by Practical Networking (YouTube, 15 min) – Excellent visualization
of OSI layers and encapsulation.

CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide (Vol. 1)  by Wendell Odom – Read Chapter 1: Networking Today
(overview of network components and basic concepts) and Chapter 2: Networking Models  (OSI
and TCP/IP models). Take notes on the purpose of each OSI layer . 
Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach  by Kurose & Ross – Skim Section 1.1: What is the
Internet?  and 1.3:  Network Edge and Core . This gives a broader context of how networks are
structured (nice to know, even if not directly tested). 
Research Papers/Articles:
“A Brief History of the Internet”  – (Leiner et al., 2009) – Internet Society  article outlining how
networks evolved. Read sections on the early ARPANET to appreciate why protocols and models
were developed. (Good for motivation and context; not directly examinable.) 
“OSI Model Reference Chart”  (Cisco Learning Network) – A concise chart describing all 7 OSI
layers with examples . Use this to quiz yourself on layer functions. 
(Industry  whitepaper) “Demystifying  SDN  for  the  Network  Engineer”  –  Cisco  whitepaper
introducing Software-Defined Networking in simple terms. Just read the intro to glimpse future
trends (you’ll revisit SDN in Month 5). 
Online Courses:
Cisco Networking Academy – Introduction to Networks (ITN) v7 : If you prefer a guided
course, sign up (free) and complete Module 1: Networking Today  and Module 2: Basic Switch and
End Device Configuration . These include lab exercises on Packet Tracer . 
freeCodeCamp’s 4-hour Networking Basics Course  (YouTube) – If you want more lecture-style
teaching on fundamentals and OSI, this video is a great supplement (covers networking basics in
a beginner-friendly way). 
Hands-On Labs/Projects:
Lab 1.1: Build Your First Network  – Using Packet Tracer , create a simple network: two PCs
connected by a switch. Assign IP addresses (e.g. PC1: 10.0.0.1/24, PC2: 10.0.0.2/24), and use the
PT simulation mode to send a ping. Observe the encapsulation (OSI layers) in the simulation
view as the ping travels . Step-by-step:  Place two PC endpoints and one switch in PT, connect
via copper straight-through cables, configure IP addresses on PCs, then ping. Expected
outcome:  PCs can ping each other successfully. Document in your notes: screenshots of your
Packet Tracer topology and a brief explanation of what each device/layer did to deliver the ping. 
Lab 1.2: Exploring Packet Tracer and CLI  – In Packet Tracer , add a Cisco 2960 switch and
console into it from a PC (using a console cable). Practice using the Cisco CLI: enter show 
version , show ip interface brief . No configuration needed, just get used to CLI
navigation (we’ll do more in Week 2). 
(Mini-Project) Home Network Mapping:  Draw a diagram of your own home network (router , Wi-
Fi AP, any devices). Identify what OSI layer each component operates at and how they connect.
This personalizes concepts like modem (Layer1/2), wireless router (Layer3), etc. 
Quizzes/Assessments:
CCNA Prep Quiz – Basics (≈20 questions) : Take a beginner quiz on network basics (try the free
quiz on ExamCompass or ExamTopics’ easy questions). Aim for 80%+. •

NetAcad Chapter Quiz:  If using NetAcad, complete the Module 1 quiz to test terminology. 
Create 5 flashcards in Anki for OSI layers (e.g. “Layer 3 name?” -> “Network layer – IP addressing,
routing”). Review these at week’s end, using spaced repetition. 
Time Allocation (approx 12 hours):
- Videos/lectures: ~3 hours (introductions, OSI model explanations).
- Reading (Odom chapters, Kurose intro): ~2 hours.
- Labs/Hands-on: ~4 hours (Packet Tracer setup and 2 labs, including documentation).
- Quizzes/Review: ~2 hours (quiz + flashcards + reviewing notes).
- Buffer/Break:  ~1 hour (spread as short breaks or an extra rest day if content is mastered quickly). 
Milestones & Checkpoints:
-  Milestone 1:  Write a one-page summary or  blog-style note  explaining “How data moves from one
computer to another over a network,” referencing the OSI model. If you can teach it simply, that’s a
great sign of understanding.
-  Milestone 2:  Submit your  Lab 1.1 report  – e.g., a screenshot of your Packet Tracer network with a
brief description of your ping results and what layers were involved.
- Score at least 80% on the basic networking quiz  (or identify wrong answers and clarify why).
-  Checkpoint:  Ensure Packet Tracer is working and you’re comfortable adding devices and using the
simulation mode. Also verify your note-taking system (Notion/OneNote) is set up with Week 1 content
neatly organized. 
Motivation:  Congratulations on starting! Networking might seem overwhelming at first, but remember
that every expert was once a beginner . You’ve learned a lot of new terms this week – celebrate that. If
some concepts (like OSI layers) still feel abstract, that’s okay; we will reinforce them in upcoming weeks.
Take a short break before Week 2, and get ready to dive deeper .
Week 2: Network Fundamentals – Protocols and Models
Objectives (Week 2):
-  Deepen  your  understanding  of  network  models  and  protocols:  specifically,  know  the  difference
between TCP and UDP  (when to use each, characteristics like reliability vs speed) .
- Learn about common  protocols at each layer  (e.g. Ethernet at Layer2, IP at Layer3, TCP/UDP at
Layer4, HTTP/FTP at Layer7) and how they relate to the CCNA blueprint.
- Master the concept of  encapsulation : how data is packaged at each layer (e.g. what a “packet” vs
“frame” vs “segment” is).
- Get introduced to basic device configuration: practice using Cisco IOS CLI commands for initial switch
setup  (hostname, interface descriptions, etc.) to prepare for upcoming network access topics.
- Start learning about Cabling and Interfaces : types of network media (fiber vs copper , Ethernet cable
categories)  and where they are used. Identify different interface types on routers/switches in Packet
Tracer . 
Resources:
- Videos/Tutorials:
-  “TCP vs UDP”  by NetworkChuck (YouTube, 15 min) – Fun, visual comparison of TCP and UDP using
analogies (e.g. phone call vs mail). Helps solidify why both exist and their pros/cons.
- Jeremy’s IT Lab Day 3 – OSI Model & TCP/IP  (YouTube, 32 min) – Goes through encapsulation and
PDUs (protocol data units) at each layer , and specifically touches on TCP vs UDP.
- CBT Nuggets “TCP/IP Fundamentals”  (if you have access, ~20 min) – An optional polished video on
how the TCP/IP stack works, featuring real-world examples. (If no access, the above free videos suffice.)
- (Optional) “How to Use Packet Tracer – Basic CLI”  (Cisco DevNet video, 10 min) – Shows how to open•

the CLI in Packet Tracer and do basic config. This overlaps with NetAcad content if you are following
that. 
Books/Chapters:
CCNA Official Cert Guide (Vol. 1)  – Read Chapter 3: Protocols and Models . Focus on sections
covering TCP/IP vs OSI, encapsulation example, and a short section on TCP vs UDP. Also read
Chapter 4: Physical Layer  (to learn about cabling and media). 
“Networking Essentials” by Cisco Press  (optional if available) – Chapter on Networking Protocols
and Communications . It’s a lighter read reinforcing similar concepts with examples. 
Quick  reference:  RFC  791  (IPv4)  and  RFC  793  (TCP)  –  Skim  the  intro  paragraphs  of  these
foundational documents to see how they describe these protocols (don’t worry about deep
details; this is just to experience reading an RFC). 
Research Papers/Articles:
“Understanding TCP/IP”  – an article on NetworkingAcademy.io or similar resource that explains
how TCP/IP model maps to OSI layers and the role of protocols at each layer (if you have
NetAcad, the course content itself is great). 
IEEE Spectrum: “Wi-Fi & Ethernet: A History”  – A short article describing how Ethernet and Wi-
Fi standards came to be. This gives insight into why certain cabling (coax, twisted-pair , fiber) and
wireless channels matter . 
(Academic) “End-to-End Arguments in System Design”  (Saltzer , Reed, Clark, 1984) – This seminal
paper introduced the principle that reliability should be handled end-to-end (which underpins
why TCP does error checking). Optional:  Read the first 2 pages to grasp the idea behind protocols
like TCP providing reliability rather than relying on network core. 
Online Courses:
Cisco NetAcad – ITN v7 Module 3: Protocols and Models  – Goes through encapsulation
process with examples; includes interactive activities. Complete Packet Tracer Activity “3.5.5:
Investigate the TCP/IP and OSI Models in Action” (this is a guided PT sim where you trace a web
request through layers) . 
Coursera  “Computer  Communications”  Week  1  (Princeton  via  Coursera,  can  audit)  –  This
offers another explanation of layering and introduces Internet design principles. A different
perspective can reinforce learning. 
Hands-On Labs/Projects:
Lab 2.1: Inspecting Packets in Wireshark  – Install Wireshark  (free packet analyzer). Use Packet
Tracer’s built-in Sniffer or your own PC’s ping. In PT: connect a PC to a PT Cloud (internet) and
generate traffic, capture it. Alternatively, on your actual computer , ping a site and capture in
Wireshark. Inspect an ICMP packet: identify the Ethernet frame header , IP header , and ICMP
data. Expected Outcome:  You can see the different protocol headers layered (Ethernet contains
IP which contains ICMP). Take a screenshot labeling the layers. 
Lab 2.2: Basic Switch Configuration  – In Packet Tracer , place a 2960 switch and a PC. On the
switch CLI, practice commands: set hostname ( hostname Week2Switch ), set a banner
message ( banner motd "Authorized Access Only" ), configure an IP on the switch’s
VLAN1 interface (e.g. 192.168.1.10/24) so you could manage it, and set up a login password on•

the console. Also practice the show interface status  and show running-config . 
Expected Outcome:  You become familiar with user EXEC vs config mode, and you have a switch
with basic settings. Save the PT file for reuse. 
Lab 2.3: Media Demonstration  – If you have different cable types in Packet Tracer (copper
straight-through vs crossover vs fiber), set up a simple test: e.g. connect two switches with the
wrong cable type and observe link down, then correct it. This will reinforce cable differences
(Copper crossover for switch-switch if no auto-MDIX, fiber needs fiber ports, etc.). 
Quizzes/Assessments:
Week 2 Quiz (30 questions)  – Covering OSI vs TCP/IP layers, protocol examples, TCP vs UDP
differences, and basic Cisco CLI commands. Sources: Try creating a custom quiz in a tool like
Quizlet, or use exam prep books’ chapter questions. Ensure you can answer: “Which OSI layer
does XYZ occur?”, “What’s the advantage of TCP over UDP and vice versa?”, “Which cable for
connecting two switches?” etc. 
NetAcad Module 3 Quiz  if using NetAcad. 
Continue adding to Anki: e.g. flashcards for “TCP vs UDP – which is connection-oriented?”,
“Default port for HTTP?”, “Command to set switch hostname?”, etc. Aim for ~15 new flashcards
this week. 
Time Allocation (~13 hours):
- Videos: ~3 hours (models, protocols, TCP/UDP)
- Reading: ~3 hours (Cert Guide chapters, articles)
- Labs/Practice: ~4 hours (Wireshark hands-on, switch CLI config, cable experiments)
- Quizzes/Flashcards/Review: ~2–3 hours (includes Anki and discussing tricky quiz answers in forums or
study group) 
Milestones & Checkpoints:
- Milestone 1:  Write a short explanation (half-page) comparing TCP vs UDP  in your own words. Include
an example application for each (e.g. “TCP for HTTP web pages because…, UDP for live video streaming
because…”). This checks your understanding of reliability vs speed trade-offs.
-  Milestone 2:  Complete the Wireshark lab and save a screenshot of a dissected packet. Label the
Ethernet, IP, and TCP/UDP headers in your screenshot as a mini-report.
- Milestone 3:  Configure a Packet Tracer switch with a hostname and IP, and successfully ping it from
a connected PC  (means your config was correct). Save this PT file as “Week2_SwitchConfig.pt”.
- Achieve at least 25/30  on the Week 2 Quiz. For any missed questions, write down an explanation after
researching the answer – this will turn mistakes into learning.
- Checkpoint:  You should now be comfortable with fundamental terminology and able to navigate the
CLI basics. If terms like “encapsulation”, “segment vs packet”, or any layer functions are still confusing,
revisit the OSI chart or ask for clarification on forums (Cisco Learning Network community is helpful). 
Motivation:  Two weeks in, great work! At this point you’ve laid the groundwork that many find abstract –
but these concepts pay off later when we configure protocols. Keep remembering why you’re doing
this: each protocol or model piece you master is a tool in your belt for real-world troubleshooting. If
you find yourself struggling, don’t hesitate to revisit resources or try a different medium (video vs text).
The next couple of weeks we’ll dive into IP addressing – arguably the heart of networking. Stay curious
and keep up the momentum!•

Week 3: IP Addressing & Subnetting (Fundamentals Part II)
Objectives (Week 3):
-  Understand  IPv4  addressing  thoroughly:  the  format  of  an  IPv4  address,  binary  representation,
network vs host portions, and the role of the subnet mask.
- Learn how to  subnet  IPv4 networks: given requirements (like X subnets or Y hosts), be able to
calculate appropriate subnet masks, network IDs, broadcast addresses, etc. This is a crucial skill for the
exam and real life.
- Practice configuring IP addresses on devices (routers, PCs) and verify connectivity within and across
subnets.
- Get introduced to  private IP vs public IP  and the need for NAT (we will configure NAT later , but
concept starts here) .
- Briefly overview IPv6 basics : understand the IPv6 address format, why IPv6 was introduced, and the
different address types (global, link-local, unique local, multicast) . We will do more IPv6 in Week
4, but start familiarizing now.
Resources:
- Videos/Tutorials:
- “IPv4 Addressing Basics”  (Cisco Networking Academy YouTube, ~15 min) – Explains how IP addresses
and subnet masks work, with examples.
- NetworkChuck “Subnetting Masterclass”  (YouTube, ~30 min) – Chuck demonstrates a quick method
to subnet, using his energetic style. He covers binary math in an accessible way.
-  Jeremy’s  IT  Lab  Day  7  &  8  –  IPv4  Addressing  Part  1  &  2  (YouTube,  ~40  min  total)  –  In-depth
subnetting lectures , including practice problems (Jeremy breaks down the process step-by-step).
Highly recommended – follow along and do the exercises he presents.
- “IPv6 Basics”  by Sunny Classroom (YouTube, 20 min) – Simple explanation of IPv6 address notation,
types, and how it differs from IPv4. A good intro before diving deeper next week. 
Books/Chapters:
CCNA Cert Guide (Vol. 1)  – Read Chapter 11: IP Addressing  (covers IPv4 addressing and intro to
subnetting). Work through the examples in the chapter by hand. Then read Chapter 12: 
Subnetting  and do the practice problems  provided. Odom’s books have practice questions at
chapter ends – ensure you attempt those. 
“31 Days Before Your CCNA”  (if available) – Day 5 and 6 cover IPv4 and subnetting in a concise
way, with practice quizzes. This can be a quick refresher once you learn from Odom. 
Computer Networking (Kurose/Ross)  – Section 4.3 covers IP addressing and CIDR. It offers a
conceptual view (skip heavy details on routing algorithms for now). 
(Reference) Subnetting Cheat Sheet  – find a reliable cheat sheet (like one on IPCisco or Cisco’s
site)  that lists common subnet sizes (/24, /25, /26, … /30) with their block size, number of
hosts, etc. Keep this for reference initially, but aim to memorize key subnet values over time. 
Research Papers/Articles:
RFC 1918 – Address Allocation for Private Internets  – skim this to see the official private IP
ranges (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16) and understand why/how they’re reserved. 
“Subnetting – Why and How”  (Cisco Blog or PacketLife article) – an article explaining real-world
use of subnetting (segmentation, reduced broadcast domains). 
Cisco Press Article: “IPv6 Address Types”  – outlines global vs link-local vs unique local, etc., in a
straightforward manner . This complements the brief IPv6 intro from videos. 79

(Optional,  deep  dive) “IPv4  Address  Exhaustion  and  NAT”  –  any  networking  journal  article
discussing how IPv4 exhaustion led to NAT and IPv6 (if curious about the bigger picture). 
Online Courses:
Cisco NetAcad – ITN v7 Modules 8 & 9 : These modules cover IP addressing and subnetting with
interactive examples. Do the lab exercises like “Subnetting scenario” if provided. NetAcad also
has a Subnetting Game  in some courses – use it to practice in a fun way. 
Udemy Free Subnetting Course  (if any exist, or simply find a free worksheet online) – Some
instructors have free sections or practice sets for subnetting. Timed subnetting quizzes help
build speed (e.g., “subnetting in your head” challenges). 
Hands-On Labs/Projects:
Lab 3.1: Subnetting Practice (Paper or Tool)  – Not a typical lab, but spend time manually
calculating  subnets. For example, take a Class C network 192.168.10.0/24 and practice making:
(a) 2 subnets (each /25), (b) 4 subnets (/26), (c) 8 subnets (/27). Write down the subnet ID,
broadcast, and valid host range for each. Do similar for a /16. Use a whiteboard or spreadsheet if
needed. Check answers with a subnet calculator to verify. 
Lab 3.2: Configure Subnets in Packet Tracer  – Build a small network with 3 subnets : e.g., one
for Branch1 PCs, one for Branch2 PCs, and one for the WAN link between two routers. For
instance: Router A (Branch1) with PC network 192.168.1.0/24, Router B (Branch2) with PC
network 192.168.2.0/24, and a /30 for the link between routers. Configure IPs on two routers’
interfaces and on a PC in each subnet. Use static routes (we haven’t formally covered yet, but you
can guess or look up how to add a static route) to ensure the two PCs can ping each other
through the routers. Expected Outcome:  Both PCs, in different IP networks, communicate via
the routers (verifying your addressing and basic routing config). This is a preview of Week 4’s
routing topics but reinforces addressing. 
Lab 3.3: IPv6 Addressing Basics  – In Packet Tracer , enable IPv6 on a router and a PC: assign a
global IPv6 address (e.g., 2001:DB8:1::1/64 on router , 2001:DB8:1::2/64 on PC) and a link-local
(should auto-generate). Ping the link-local and global addresses to test connectivity. If unfamiliar
with IPv6 config, use a guide. Expected Outcome:  You can configure and verify IPv6 addressing
on Cisco IOS and understand the abbreviations. Document one example of an IPv6 address you
used and identify its parts (network prefix, interface ID). 
Quizzes/Assessments:
Subnetting Speed Quiz:  time yourself to find answers to 5 subnetting questions (e.g., “How
many hosts in a /27?”, “What is the subnet mask for 4 subnets of /24?”). Resources like
subnettingpractice.com or random question generators help. Aim to get each within 1-2 minutes
without referring to notes. 
Boson ExSim (if available) Subnetting section  – Boson practice exams have great subnetting
questions. If you have access, try a subset. If not, use free question dumps carefully on
ExamTopics – focus on understanding, not memorizing answers. 
Chapter-end questions from Odom  – do all at end of IP addressing chapters. 
Continue adding flashcards: e.g., “Subnet mask /26 = ? 255.255.255.192, hosts?”, “Private IP
ranges?”, “IPv6 link-local prefix?”. Daily review previous cards – by now ~30+ cards in deck.

- Reading & Note-taking: ~3 hours (addressing chapters, articles)
- Subnetting practice (paper/calculations): ~3 hours (spread out in sessions)
- Packet Tracer labs: ~4 hours (multi-subnet network, IPv6 config)
- Quizzes & flashcards: ~2 hours (including timed practice) 
Milestones & Checkpoints:
- Milestone 1:  Be able to subnet a network in under 10 minutes  for a given scenario. For example,
“Design an IP scheme for a company with 3 departments (50 hosts, 30 hosts, 20 hosts). What subnets
do you use out of 192.168.10.0/24?” – Write out your solution and rationale.
- Milestone 2:  Complete Lab 3.2 (2-router , 2-PC network) and demonstrate a successful ping from a PC
on Router A’s network to a PC on Router B’s network. This shows you can correctly assign IPs and even
set a basic static route. Save this lab as “Week3_RoutingIntro.pt”.
-  Milestone 3:  List the three private IPv4 ranges from memory and explain in a few sentences  why
private addresses need NAT to reach the Internet. Similarly, list at least two types of IPv6 addresses
(e.g., “Link-local starts with FE80, used only on local link”).
- Checkpoint:  By end of Week 3, subnetting should feel more comfortable.  If you still struggle, schedule
extra practice – it’s that important. Consider using a  subnetting app or game  daily for speed. Also
check that you haven’t neglected earlier topics: try explaining to yourself how OSI layers relate now that
you’ve added IP (Layer3) knowledge. 
Motivation:  Subnetting is often a hurdle for beginners – if you’ve cracked it this week, give yourself a pat
on the back! If not, don’t panic; it  will click with continued practice. Many find it helpful to teach
someone else (or an imaginary student) the process – this solidifies your mastery. You’re now halfway
through  the  fundamentals  phase.  Keep  up  the  disciplined  study  habits.  Next  week  we’ll  wrap  up
Network Fundamentals with more on IPv6, wireless, and some network services. 
Week 4: Wrapping up Fundamentals (IPv6, Wireless, Visualization, Review)
Objectives (Week 4):
- Solidify understanding of IPv6 : cover address types in more detail (global unicast, unique local, link-
local, multicast, anycast) and IPv6 configuration on Cisco devices (SLAAC, DHCPv6 concepts).
- Learn basic network troubleshooting tools : ping, traceroute , and OS commands to verify IP
configuration ( ipconfig /ifconfig  on host OSes) . By CCNA blueprint, you should know how to
verify IP parameters on Windows, Mac, Linux.
- Explore wireless fundamentals : non-overlapping Wi-Fi channels (2.4GHz vs 5GHz), what an SSID is,
basics of Wi-Fi security (WPA2). This ties into Network Fundamentals (1.11 wireless principles) and
Security Fundamentals (5.9 wireless security protocols) .
- Introduction to network virtualization : concepts of VLAN (virtual LAN) vs VRF vs VPN (just definitions;
we will configure  VLANs in Month 2, but here understand that virtualization allows multiple networks on
same physical infrastructure). Also understand what a server virtualization  and container  means in
networking contexts  (to meet 1.12 blueprint).
- Conduct a  Month 1 review : revisit all main topics (devices, OSI, TCP/UDP, addressing). Identify any
weak areas before moving to Month 2. 
Resources:
- Videos/Tutorials:
- “IPv6 Address Types”  (KEITH Barker YouTube, ~20 min) – Keith (or similar instructor) explaining global
vs local vs link-local addresses, multicast, and how IPv6 addresses auto-configure.
- Jeremy’s IT Lab Day 31-33 – IPv6 Parts 1-3  (YouTube, ~30 min each) – These cover IPv6 addressing
and configuration in detail. Perhaps focus on Day 31 (IPv6 basics) and Day 32 (configuring IPv6) for now,
and we can revisit Day 33 later for advanced IPv6 routing concepts.83

- “Wireless Networking Basics”  (Cisco or CompTIA Network+ channel, ~15 min) – Introduction to Wi-Fi
standards (802.11), frequencies, channels, and security basics.
- “Intro to VLANs”  (NetworkChuck, 10 min) – Though we’ll do VLANs next month, watch this short video
to  conceptualize  network  segmentation  (it  reinforces  the  idea  of  virtualization  at  Layer2,  part  of
blueprint 1.12).
-  (Optional) “Basic  Troubleshooting  Tools”  (CBT  Nuggets  or  Professor  Messer ,  10  min)  –  A  quick
overview of using ping, traceroute, etc., on different OSes. 
Books/Chapters:
CCNA Cert Guide (Vol. 1)  – Read Chapter 13: IPv6 Addressing & Subnetting . Focus on the sections
about IPv6 address types and the configuration examples (don’t get bogged down in IPv6
subnetting – just know it conceptually, since CCNA may have a few IPv6 questions but not heavy
calculation). 
Cert Guide Chapter 5: Network Protocols  (if not already covered) – Contains a section on ICMP
(ping, traceroute) and basic DHCP/ARP concepts. This ties up some loose ends in fundamentals
(knowing ARP as a link-layer address resolution, for example). 
CWNA (Certified Wireless Network Administrator) Study Guide  (if accessible) – skim the intro
chapter on WLAN fundamentals to understand SSID, channels, and basic wireless security.
Alternatively, any Cisco Press Wireless Fundamentals  chapter if available. 
Virtualization/Cloud  Basics:  A  short  chapter  or  whitepaper  on  virtualization  (e.g.,  “Intro  to
Virtualization” by VMware or Cisco’s Network Virtualization whitepaper) – focus on the idea of
running multiple logical networks on one physical set of devices (this concept underlies VLANs,
VRFs, and SDN). 
Research Papers/Articles:
Cisco Blog: “IPv6 – The Next Generation Internet”  – an article by Cisco explaining why IPv6 is
important, with some real-world adoption info. 
“The TCP/IP vs OSI Debate”  – historical perspective article on why both models exist. (Good
read to wrap up your understanding of models.) 
Cisco Whitepaper: “Networking in Virtualized Environments”  – describes challenges and
solutions when multiple VMs share a host (introduces virtual switches, etc.). Just read the
overview to fulfill blueprint 1.12 context. 
OSI Model Quiz/Chart  – one more glance at a reference (StationX OSI cheat sheet  or similar)
to ensure you can mentally map all layers after learning these services (e.g., know that ping uses
ICMP at Layer3, traceroute also uses Layer3, etc.). 
Online Courses:
Cisco NetAcad – Module 10 (IPv6 Addressing) : Go through this module, which includes
activities on configuring IPv6 addresses and maybe an IPv6 Packet Tracer exercise. 
Cisco NetAcad – Module 17 (Network Troubleshooting) : This might be in the later part of the
course; if accessible, check out the portion on using ping and traceroute effectively. 
Labs from previous weeks : Consider redoing any NetAcad Packet Tracer labs now without
looking at instructions, as a self-test.

Lab 4.1: IPv6 Neighbor Discovery  – Extend Lab 3.3 (the IPv6 lab). Configure two routers
connected via IPv6. Enable OSPFv3 or simply static routes for IPv6 to see end-to-end connectivity.
Also, test the SLAAC  feature: on a router interface, enable it to advertise a prefix (turn on IPv6
unicast-routing and use ipv6 address prefix/64 eui-64  on interface, or SLAAC configs).
Configure a PC to get an IPv6 address automatically. Expected Outcome:  The PC autoconfigures
a global IPv6 address (stateless) and can reach the router . Check the PC’s IPv6 config to see link-
local and autoconfigured addresses. 
Lab 4.2: Wireless Router in Packet Tracer  – PT has generic wireless routers. Set up a PT home
wireless router , give it an SSID “Week4WiFi” with WPA2 password, and add a PC with a PT wireless
NIC to connect to it. See if you can ping between wireless PC and a wired PC on that router . 
Expected Outcome:  Understand how a wireless client associates via SSID/security to an AP. (This
lab is limited but gives a conceptual demo. Real gear would be needed for full effect, but PT can
simulate a bit.) 
Lab 4.3: Basic Troubleshooting Scenarios  – Deliberately break things in a small PT network and
practice troubleshooting: e.g., take a simple two-router network and misconfigure IP on one
side, or use wrong default gateway on a PC, then use ping and traceroute  from the
devices to identify the issue. Document one scenario: describe the symptoms (e.g., PC1 can’t
reach PC2), your troubleshooting steps (ping X, got no reply, etc.), the identified problem, and
the fix. 
(Project) Fundamentals Summary Mind-Map:  As a wrap-up for Month 1, create a visual mind-
map or diagram that connects the concepts learned: Show how OSI layers relate to specific
protocols (HTTP at Layer7, TCP at Layer4, IP at Layer3, Ethernet at Layer2), list device types and
where they operate, illustrate an IPv4 vs IPv6 address example, and indicate how subnetting
breaks a network. Making this map will reinforce the holistic view. 
Quizzes/Assessments:
End-of-Month Fundamentals Exam:  Take a comprehensive practice test on all topics covered in
Month 1 (maybe 50 questions). You can use a mix of resources: some questions from ExamTopics
(filter by fundamentals), some from Odom’s end-of-part quizzes, or a free online CCNA
fundamentals test. Treat it like a real exam: timed 60 minutes for 50 questions. 
Boson ExSim lite : If you have Boson, perhaps attempt a subset of one exam focusing on early-
domain questions. 
Skill drill : Perform a “Layer-by-Layer” drill – for a given scenario (like loading a webpage),
verbally walk through each OSI layer and what happens. This isn’t a formal quiz but a cognitive
exercise to test integrated understanding. Possibly do this with a friend or mentor if available, or
record yourself. 
Time Allocation (~12 hours):
- Videos: ~2 hours (IPv6 and wireless intros)
- Reading: ~2 hours (IPv6 chapter , wireless section, virtualization article)
- Labs: ~5 hours (IPv6 configs, wireless PT, troubleshooting practice)
- Review & Quizzes: ~3 hours (including the 50-question test and analysis of answers, plus assembling
the mind-map project) 
Milestones & Checkpoints:
- Milestone 1:  Configure IPv6 on two routers and two PCs (as in Lab 4.1) so that all devices can ping
each other’s IPv6 global addresses. This confirms understanding of IPv6 addressing and basic routing.
Save lab “Week4_IPv6.pt”.
- Milestone 2:  Write a short explanation of a real-world scenario using each wireless security protocol• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
12

(e.g., “WPA2 is currently common for home Wi-Fi, WPA3 is newer and more secure, WEP is obsolete”).
Also list 3 non-overlapping channels in 2.4GHz (1, 6, 11) to demonstrate wireless basics knowledge.
- Milestone 3:  Complete the Month 1 practice exam (50 Qs) with a score of ~80% or higher . Review each
wrong answer and write down why the correct answer is correct. If score < 80%, identify weak areas and
plan a revision in Week 5 (we can allocate some review time then).
- Checkpoint: Fundamentals phase complete!  You should now be confident in network foundational
concepts. Verify that you have: a solid grasp of IP addressing and can do subnetting relatively quickly;
familiarity with the CLI; understanding of how different network components function and interact. Any
lingering confusion here should be addressed before moving on, as Months 2–4 will build on this
foundation. Don’t hesitate to use community forums or study groups to clarify doubts. 
Motivation:  Month 1 down – awesome job. Many newcomers falter at the abstract concepts stage, but
you’ve persevered. Now you have a base to build on. Take a moment to reflect on how much you’ve
learned in just four weeks. Networking might still feel vast (it is), but piece by piece, you are conquering
it. Stay curious and stay disciplined.  Next month, we’ll start configuring networks in earnest (VLANs,
routing, etc.), which is where the fun really begins because you’ll make things  work ! Enjoy a well-
deserved rest day before Month 2, and maybe reward yourself (you’ve earned it!).
Month 2: Network Access and Switching Essentials
(Fundamentals Part III + Intro to Network Access)
Focus:  Month 2 transitions from pure theory into more hands-on switching and network access  topics.
We’ll cover the CCNA Network Access domain (VLANs, STP, EtherChannel, wireless LANs in more depth)
and finish any remaining fundamentals (like ARP, DHCP basics) as they tie in. By the end of Month 2,
you’ll have configured VLANs, understood how switches prevent loops with STP, and set up a basic
wireless LAN. We’ll also continue practicing subnetting and introduce more troubleshooting and design
thinking.  Domains covered:  Network Access (CCNA domain 2.0) in-depth, plus relevant IP Services
basics (DHCP, ARP) and revisit Network Fundamentals concepts in practice.
Week 5: VLANs and Inter-VLAN Routing
Objectives (Week 5):
- Understand VLAN concepts : what VLANs are, how they provide network segmentation at Layer 2, and
default VLAN behavior .
- Learn to  configure VLANs  on Cisco switches: create VLANs, assign switch ports to VLANs (access
ports) , understand the concept of the management VLAN  and native VLAN.
- Implement  Inter-VLAN routing : since different VLANs are different subnets, you need a router or
Layer 3 switch to route between them. We’ll configure Router-on-a-Stick  (a router with subinterfaces
for each VLAN) to enable devices in different VLANs to communicate.
- Practice troubleshooting VLAN issues : e.g., mismatched VLANs, incorrect IP addressing for VLANs.
- Reinforce subnetting with a real config: design IP subnets for each VLAN in a network and apply them. 
Resources:
- Videos/Tutorials:
- “VLANs Explained”  by Kevin Wallace (YouTube, 20 min) – Great conceptual intro to VLANs, why we use
them, with simple diagrams.
- Jeremy’s IT Lab Day 12 – VLANs  (YouTube, ~30 min) – Goes into normal-range VLAN config, access
ports, verifying VLANs on a switch, etc.
-  NetworkChuck “Router on a Stick”  (YouTube, 15 min) – Demonstrates inter-VLAN routing using a
router with subinterfaces, with a bit of fun flair . This helps visualize how one router interface can handle87

13

multiple VLANs via trunk.
- CBT Nuggets “Inter-VLAN Routing”  (if you have access, ~15 min) – shows configuration on a Layer 3
switch as well as router-on-a-stick. If no CBT, look for another free video on inter-VLAN routing (e.g.,
David Bombal has some). 
Books/Chapters:
CCNA Cert Guide (Vol. 1)  – Read Chapter 10: LAN Switching Fundamentals  and Chapter 11 (if
present in Vol1) or relevant sections on VLANs and trunking. Pay attention to commands like 
switchport mode access , switchport access vlan X , vlan database  vs VLAN
config mode (depending on IOS). Also read the part on 802.1Q trunking  – what it is and how the
native VLAN works . 
Official Cert Guide (Vol. 2)  – If Vol.2 covers Inter-VLAN routing, read that chapter (likely early in
Vol2). It will explain router-on-a-stick configuration and multilayer switching. 
“CCNA 200-301 Network Access” (Odom’s condensed notes)  – If available, Cisco Press often
has an exam review guide summarizing VLAN and STP topics. Use it to review key points after
learning. 
Lab manual:  “31 Days Before CCNA”  – see if there’s a day on VLANs or trunking and do the
exercises. 
Research Papers/Articles:
Cisco Document: “Configuring VLANs”  – official Cisco docs on VLAN config (on Catalyst
switches). Skim for any best practices (like naming VLANs, using VLAN 1 or not, etc.). 
“The Death of VLAN 1”  (blog) – an article explaining why you should not use VLAN 1 for
management (common security advice). This adds real-world flavor to your VLAN knowledge. 
Cisco Support Forum thread on Router-on-a-Stick  – read a Q&A or troubleshooting case to see
common mistakes (e.g., forgetting to set the router port as trunk or mismatched native VLAN). 
(Design) “LAN  Segmentation  and  VLANs”  –  chapter  from  an  older  Cisco  design  guide  or
whitepaper explaining how VLANs are used in network design. Focus on the rationale (security,
reduce broadcasts, etc.). 
Online Courses:
Cisco NetAcad – Switching, Routing & Wireless Essentials (SRWE) v7 : If you finished ITN, the
second course SRWE covers VLANs early on. Complete Chapter 2: VLANs, and Chapter 3: Inter-
VLAN Routing. There will be Packet Tracer labs for both (do them!). 
Labs from Packet Tracer Tutorials  – Cisco PT has some built-in sample labs (check “Open
Sample” in PT). Look for any labeled VLAN or trunking to practice. 
Udemy (optional)  – If you find a cheap CCNA lab course, you can do a VLAN lab with them; but
likely your own practice is enough. 
Hands-On Labs/Projects:
Lab 5.1: VLAN Configuration and Ping Test  – In Packet Tracer , set up one switch with 3 PCs on
it. Create 2 VLANs (say VLAN10 and VLAN20). Put 2 PCs on VLAN10, and 1 PC on VLAN20. Assign
IP addresses such that PCs in different VLANs are on different subnets (e.g., VLAN10 uses
192.168.10.0/24, VLAN20 uses 192.168.20.0/24). Initially, do not configure any router . Verify that•

two PCs in the same VLAN can ping each other (should work), but PCs in different VLANs cannot
(expected, since no inter-VLAN routing yet). This shows VLAN segmentation. 
Lab 5.2: Router-on-a-Stick  – Extend Lab 5.1 by adding a Router (2911 or similar in PT) and
connecting the switch to the router with one link. Configure that switch port as a trunk
(switchport mode trunk ) and on the router configure subinterfaces: e.g. Gig0/0.10  for
VLAN10, Gig0/0.20  for VLAN20, assign 192.168.10.1 and 192.168.20.1 respectively. Don’t
forget encapsulation dot1Q 10  etc. Now set each PC’s default gateway to the router’s
subinterface IP (PCs in VLAN10 use 192.168.10.1). Expected Outcome:  PCs in different VLANs
can now ping each other through the router . Also test pinging the router gateways. Save this lab
as “Week5_VLAN_RouterOnStick.pt”. 
Lab 5.3: Trunking and Native VLAN  – Add a second switch to Lab 5.2, connected via a trunk link
to the first switch. Put one PC on the second switch on VLAN10. Ensure trunk is up (use show 
interfaces trunk ). The PC on switch2 VLAN10 should communicate with PCs on switch1
VLAN10. Experiment by changing native VLAN on one side and see the effect (noticing errors or
ping issues if mismatched). Then set them correctly. Expected Outcome:  Understanding of how
trunks carry multiple VLANs and the importance of matching native VLANs. 
(Mini-Project) VLAN Design Document:  Imagine a small office network for a company with 3
departments (e.g., Sales, Engineering, Guest WiFi). Sketch a simple network diagram showing 3
VLANs, how they connect to a router or L3 switch for inter-VLAN routing, and propose an IP
range for each. Write a paragraph justifying the VLAN segmentation (e.g., “to isolate guest traffic
from internal”, etc.). This is a design exercise to apply VLAN knowledge conceptually. 
Quizzes/Assessments:
VLAN/Trunking Quiz:  ~15 questions focused on VLAN concepts. E.g., “What command assigns a
port to VLAN 10?”, “Which VLAN ID range is normal vs extended?”, “What is the purpose of the
native VLAN?”, “True/False: Devices in different VLANs can communicate without a router .” Use
CCNA exam prep question banks or the NetAcad chapter quiz. 
Inter-VLAN routing quiz:  ~10 questions on router-on-a-stick config (e.g., identify missing config
in a scenario, or understand subinterface numbering). 
Review past topics:  include 5 mixed questions from Month 1 topics (to keep memory fresh). 
Flashcards: add key VLAN-related commands and concepts (e.g., “Default VLAN = ? (VLAN1)”,
“802.1Q tag adds how many bytes? (4 bytes)”, “Router-on-a-stick requires what encapsulation
command?”, etc.). 
Time Allocation (~13 hours):
- Videos: ~2 hours (VLAN + inter-VLAN demos)
- Reading: ~2 hours (Cert Guide + articles)
- Labs/Practical: ~6 hours (it will take time to configure, test, troubleshoot VLAN labs, especially trunking
with multiple switches)
- Quizzes & flashcards: ~2 hours
- Note consolidation: ~1 hour (documenting lab results, updating your notes with configurations done
and lessons learned) 
Milestones & Checkpoints:
- Milestone 1:  Successfully implement a router-on-a-stick with at least 2 VLANs and verify connectivity
between  VLANs via the router . Confirm by screenshotting ping tests from a PC in VLAN10 to a PC in
VLAN20, along with a show ip interface brief  on the router showing subinterfaces up.
- Milestone 2:  Describe in your notes the difference between an Access Port  and a Trunk Port . List the
commands to configure each. Also note the typical native VLAN (default 1) and how to change it.•

- Milestone 3:  Score 80%+ on the VLAN/Inter-VLAN quizzes. If any VLAN concept is wrong (for example,
confusion about extended VLAN range or how trunk tagging works), revisit that portion in Odom or
videos until clear .
- Checkpoint:  You’ve now done substantial switch configuration. Ensure you can confidently navigate
show vlan , show interfaces trunk , and understand what it means. If possible, discuss with a
peer or in a forum one of your labs (explaining what you did helps cement knowledge). Heading into
Week 6, we’ll tackle Spanning Tree and EtherChannel, which build on the VLAN/trunk knowledge. Make
sure trunking is solid in your mind (we’ll see why STP is needed when redundancy is introduced). 
Motivation:  Setting up VLANs is your first real network engineering  task – you segmented a network and
made them talk. This is exactly what network engineers do in enterprises. Reflect on how far you’ve
come from “what is a network” to actually configuring multi-VLAN networks! The first time is always the
hardest; it gets easier . If things didn’t work initially, that’s normal – troubleshooting and figuring out why
(maybe a missing encapsulation  command or mis-assigned port) is where real learning happens.
Embrace those moments. Keep this momentum into Week 6.
Week 6: Spanning Tree and EtherChannel (Switch Resiliency)
Objectives (Week 6):
- Understand the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) : why it exists (prevent switching loops), how it elects a
root bridge and manages port states (forwarding/blocking) . Learn the basics of Rapid PVST+
(the Cisco default spanning tree mode) and terms like Root Port, Designated Port, Blocking/Alternate Port
.
- Configure STP settings on switches: not in-depth (CCNA is limited here), but know how to identify the
root bridge ( show spanning-tree  output) and adjust priorities to influence root election, if required.
-  Learn  about  EtherChannel  (Link  Aggregation) :  purpose  (increase  bandwidth  and  provide
redundancy by bundling links) . Understand the protocols LACP (open standard) vs PAgP (Cisco
proprietary) for negotiating EtherChannels.
-  Configure  a  simple  EtherChannel  between  two  switches  in  Packet  Tracer  using  LACP  (since  PT
supports it). Verify with show etherchannel summary .
- Continue  wireless and security fundamentals : If not covered yet, ensure understanding of how
enterprise wireless differs (AP & WLC architectures, which we’ll touch in Week 7) and how spanning tree
and EtherChannel might interplay with Wi-Fi (mostly separate topics but complete the network access
domain fully).
- Integrate knowledge with a larger lab: by now, you know VLANs, routing, STP, EtherChannel – attempt
a lab combining these (see Hands-On). 
Resources:
- Videos/Tutorials:
- “Spanning Tree Protocol Basics”  by Keith Barker (YouTube, 30 min) – Keith often uses animations to
show how STP elects root and blocks certain ports to break loops. This is valuable to visualize the
process.
- Jeremy’s IT Lab Day 13 – Spanning Tree  (YouTube, ~20 min) – Focuses on the need for STP and basics
of port roles/states. Jeremy keeps CCNA STP coverage straightforward.
- NetworkChuck “Spanning Tree in 5 Minutes”  (YouTube, 5 min) – a high-level quick recap of STP (for a
bit of fun revision).
-  “EtherChannel Explained”  by David Bombal (YouTube, 15 min) – Shows EtherChannel config and
verification, plus common mistakes (like ports not matching settings).1920

-  CBT  Nuggets  “EtherChannel”  (if  access,  10  min)  –  Another  demonstration,  perhaps  using  real
equipment. If not, the free Bombal video suffices. 
Books/Chapters:
CCNA Cert Guide (Vol. 1 or 2)  – Find the section on Spanning Tree Protocol (likely in Vol.2 under
LAN switching). Read the parts about STP operations , RSTP improvements , and the CCNA-level
detail of PVST+ (per-VLAN STP). Note: memorize STP port states (Blocking, Listening, Learning,
Forwarding, Disabled) and port roles (Root, Designated, Alternate) – Odom’s text will cover these
clearly. 
Also read about Layer 2 EtherChannel  in the Cert Guide. Focus on configuration guidelines (all
member ports must have same speed/duplex, be in same VLAN or trunk mode, etc.) and LACP
modes ( active/passive ). 
“Spanning Tree Protocol” (Cisco Press Chapter)  – if you have a CCNA or CCNP Switching book,
one chapter on STP will reinforce your understanding. Pay attention to how BPDU (Bridge
Protocol Data Units) are used to elect the root and settle port roles. 
Errata or recent updates:  Check if any CCNA update added topics like BPDU Guard  or PortFast
basics (these are mentioned in blueprint: PortFast benefits ). If so, read about those features
(PortFast allows edge ports to skip STP listening/learning, BPDU Guard disables a PortFast port if
unexpected BPDUs seen – important for security). 
Research Papers/Articles:
IEEE 802.1D spec (overview)  – not suggesting to read the standard, but maybe find a summary
article about how the 802.1D Spanning Tree algorithm works. Good for conceptual clarity if
interested. 
Cisco Whitepaper: “Understanding Rapid Spanning Tree (802.1w)”  – an article or doc
explaining how RSTP achieves faster convergence than traditional STP. Only read the intro and
maybe the part about how port roles differ (alternate/discarding vs blocking). 
Networking Forum discussions  – find a Q&A on something like “Why did my EtherChannel not
form?” or “STP blocking port on redundant link – is it working correctly?” to see real-world
application of these concepts. 
EtherChannel vs STP design  – a blog that explains how EtherChannel can be used to prevent
STP from needing to block ports (because from STP’s perspective, an EtherChannel is one logical
link). This is more design-oriented but enriches understanding.

Cisco NetAcad – SRWE v7 Module 4: STP  and Module 5: EtherChannel. Go through these
chapters, do the Packet Tracer activities such as “4.6.6 Packet Tracer – Investigate STP” (if
available) where you can see STP in action, and “5.x.x Packet Tracer – Configure EtherChannel”.
These labs align perfectly with our objectives. 
Lab challenges : Some online resources have “challenge labs” for CCNA (like showing a network
diagram and asking you to configure STP priorities, etc.). If you find one, try it out. 
Practice exam on L2 : If your study resources have topic-wise exams, take one on “Network
Access” at the end of this week to gauge your progress on switching topics.

Lab 6.1: Spanning Tree Exploration  – Use your Lab 5.3 topology (two switches connected by
two links? If not, create a scenario with 2 switches and 2 redundant links between them, plus a
couple PCs). By default STP will block one link. Use show spanning-tree  on each switch to
identify the root bridge, root ports, and blocked port. Task:  Change the bridge priority on one
switch to make it the root for VLAN1 deliberately (e.g., spanning-tree vlan 1 priority 
4096). Observe how STP reconverges and which ports are now forwarding/blocking. Also test
PortFast: set one of the PC access ports as PortFast ( spanning-tree portfast  on Cisco). The
PC’s port should go into forwarding immediately on link up (in PT this might be hard to notice,
but conceptually note it). Expected Outcome:  You can interpret STP status and influence root
election. Document which switch became root and which port got blocked and why. 
Lab 6.2: Configure EtherChannel (LACP)  – Take two switches with 4 connections between them
(or add additional links to an existing topology). Before EtherChannel, STP would block all but
one. Now configure EtherChannel: e.g. on both switches do interface range f0/1-2 , 
channel-group 1 mode active  (LACP active). Do same for f0/1-2 on the other switch (active
or passive mode). This should form an EtherChannel bundling two ports. Verify with show 
etherchannel summary . Ensure you assign the EtherChannel (Port-channel1) as trunk or
access appropriately. Expected Outcome:  The EtherChannel comes up (flags “SU” in summary)
and STP now sees it as a single link, preventing loops while both physical links carry traffic. Test
by sending pings while bringing down one member link to see traffic continues. 
Lab 6.3: Integrated Network Challenge  – Design a scenario that uses everything from Month
2: e.g., 3 switches in a triangle (redundant connections), with VLANs on each, trunk links between
them, an EtherChannel on one side of the triangle, and a router or multilayer switch for inter-
VLAN routing. This is a mini-“capstone” for switching. Example : Switch1 (VLAN10,20), Switch2
(VLAN10,20), Switch3 (VLAN10,20); connect S1-S2-S3 in a triangle (introducing STP). Put an
EtherChannel between S1 and S2 (2 links bundled). Connect a router to S1 for routing between
VLAN10 and 20 (router-on-stick). Now predict STP: which switch becomes root (set priorities if
needed), which ports block, etc. Configure everything and test pings between hosts in VLAN10
and VLAN20 across different switches. Expected Outcome:  A functioning network where any
host in VLAN10 can reach any host in VLAN20 (via router), and STP is active but no broadcast
storms occur (you can test by temporarily creating a switching loop without STP to see the effect
if curious—but be careful in PT, it might not emulate broadcast storms well). This lab will be
complex; allocate plenty of time and do it step by step. It’s okay if it’s challenging – better to
struggle in practice than in exam or real life. 
(Project) Research Current Tech:  Spend an hour researching  Software-Defined Access (SD-
Access)  or modern campus designs just to see how technologies like Spine-Leaf architecture
(from blueprint 1.2)  relate. Write a short note on how traditional STP-based designs differ
from fabric (SDN) designs. This is to connect your newly gained traditional network knowledge
with where the industry is heading (tying into Automation domain, but lightly). 
Quizzes/Assessments:
STP Quiz:  ~15 questions: covering root bridge election (e.g., given priorities and MACs, who
becomes root?), port states, PortFast/BDPU Guard concept (maybe 1 question if any), and
understanding STP output (“Which port is in blocking state on Switch X given this topology?”
type). Use NetAcad quiz or exam bank. 
EtherChannel Quiz:  ~5 questions on config and theory: LACP vs PAgP, requirements for
EtherChannel, etc. 
Week 6 review Quiz:  ~10 mixed questions revisiting VLANs, trunking, routing. Perhaps a mini-
case: “PC A cannot ping PC B in another VLAN – what could be the issue?” to integrate
knowledge. •

Boson/ExamTopics practice:  If you have access to a bank of questions, filter some on spanning-
tree and attempt them. STP can be tricky in wording, so good to practice exam-like questions. 
Continue Anki: add STP timers (forward delay, max age), default priority, and EtherChannel
modes as flashcards. At this point you likely have ~50-60 flashcards – schedule time every couple
days to do your reviews (spaced repetition will make recall faster on exam). 
Time Allocation (~14 hours):
- Videos: ~2 hours (STP and EtherChannel)
- Reading/detailed study: ~3 hours (Odom chapters on STP/EtherChannel, plus articles)
- Labs: ~7 hours (STP experiments, EtherChannel config, integrated challenge lab)
-  Quizzes/Review:  ~2  hours  (includes  analyzing  any  complex  STP  questions  you  got  wrong,  as
understanding those is key) 
Milestones & Checkpoints:
-  Milestone 1:  Identify the STP root bridge in your Lab 6.1 and explain  why it’s root (lowest priority/
MAC). List the root port on each non-root switch and which port is blocking. If you can do this, you have
a practical grasp of STP operation.
- Milestone 2:  Successfully create an EtherChannel that remains up (no err-disabled ports). Show output
of  show etherchannel summary  and  show spanning-tree  (to confirm STP sees the bundled
link). Note how STP now treats the bundle – e.g., one port-channel as root port instead of individual
links.
-  Milestone 3:  In the integrated network lab, achieve full connectivity and demonstrate redundancy
(e.g., if you have a triangle, temporarily shutdown one link and show traffic still flows). Document any
troubleshooting you had to do (for learning reflection).
- Milestone 4:  Scores: Aim for ~80% on STP/EtherChannel quizzes. STP is often tricky, so if you scored
lower , pinpoint the confusion (common ones: how tie-breakers work for root port election – usually
lowest path cost, then lowest sender bridge ID, then lowest port ID; or misunderstanding PortFast vs
normal ports). Clarify these via additional reading or asking an experienced friend/mentor .
-  Checkpoint:  Network Access domain should now be largely covered. Confirm you have covered:
VLANs, trunking, STP (Rapid PVST+ basics), EtherChannel, and also wireless AP basics (if not, we will
touch WLC more next week). Also, how do you feel about Network Fundamentals content now? These
weeks likely reinforced IP addressing (since you used it in VLANs) and OSI (spanning tree is layer 2,
routing at layer 3). If any fundamental concept still feels shaky, flag it for extra review. 
Motivation:  You’ve completed 1/3 of the journey! By mastering switching, you have opened the door to
building robust local networks. STP might have felt a bit abstract (it’s under-the-hood magic ensuring
loop-free topology), but it’s a classic technology – knowing it sets you apart. If EtherChannel config gave
you trouble, that’s normal; labbing it repeatedly is the key. Now you have quite a few lab files saved –
this is your personal portfolio of configurations . Keep them safe; you can revisit them as templates
or show them to demonstrate skills. Coming up: Month 3 will tackle  routing (IP Connectivity)  – the
logic that glues networks together . That’s another exciting area where you’ll configure routers to handle
traffic across networks. Take a deep breath, maybe a day off, and get ready for routing!
Month 3: Routing & IP Connectivity (Core Routing Protocols and
Services)
Focus:  Month 3 dives into the IP Connectivity domain (25%)  – configuring and understanding routing.
We will cover static routing and the OSPF routing protocol in detail, as well as first-hop redundancy
protocols conceptually. We’ll integrate IP Services like DHCP, NAT, and NTP as we set up networks that
need those services. By the end of Month 3, you will have built multi-router topologies, configured•

dynamic routing with OSPF, and implemented common IP services in labs. Domains covered:  Primarily
IP Connectivity  (CCNA 3.0) and parts of IP Services  (CCNA 4.0) like DHCP, NTP as needed in labs.
Week 7: Static Routing and Redundant Default Gateways
Objectives (Week 7):
- Learn how routers  forward packets  by default: refresh longest-prefix-match routing logic  and
administrative distance basics.
- Configure static routes  on Cisco routers: host routes, network routes, default routes (quad-zero)
. Understand when to use static routing (small or stub networks) and its limitations.
-  Practice  troubleshooting  routing  issues:  e.g.,  missing  static  route  or  wrong  next-hop  causing  no
connectivity.
- Introduce  First-Hop Redundancy Protocols (FHRP)  concepts: HSRP/VRRP/GLBP (the exam expects
you to know what they are and purpose , but not to configure them). Understand that they provide a
virtual gateway IP  so that if one router fails, another takes over – ensuring default gateway availability.
- Implement a simple HSRP or VRRP scenario in Packet Tracer if possible (PT supports basic HSRP
configuration on routers). This is to visualize how two routers can share an IP for redundancy.
- Revisit ARP  and how it works in routing: ensure understanding that when a router forwards to next-
hop, it uses ARP to get the MAC. This ties back to fundamentals and helps troubleshoot layer 3 vs layer
2 issues. 
Resources:
- Videos/Tutorials:
-  Jeremy’s IT Lab Day 11 – Routing Fundamentals & Static Routing  (YouTube, ~30 min)  –
Excellent coverage on how routing tables work and step-by-step static route configuration.
- NetworkChuck “Subnetting & Routing”  or similar (YouTube, ~10 min) – Some quick video showing
how packets get routed between subnets, reinforcing the concept we experienced in labs.
-  Cisco CCNA Gold Labs – Static Routes  (if available on YouTube, e.g., a lab walkthrough by David
Bombal or Chris Bryant). Visualizing multiple routers and static routes can help.
-  “FHRPs (HSRP vs VRRP vs GLBP)”  by Kevin Wallace (YouTube, ~15 min) – Explains the difference
between these redundancy protocols and basic operation (active/standby, etc.).
- (Optional) “Floating Static Routes”  (Keith Barker , 5 min) – Very short explanation of a static route with
higher administrative distance to serve as backup (ties into FHRP concept by achieving similar backup
effect at routing level). 
Books/Chapters:
CCNA Cert Guide (Vol. 2)  – Read the chapter on IP Routing (should cover static routing and intro
to dynamic routing). Focus on how to configure static routes ( ip route  command variants).
There's likely a section on first-hop redundancy in the IP Services part – read that to know
definitions of HSRP/VRRP/GLBP (they might not require configuration, but Odom will describe
how HSRP works with virtual MAC, etc.). 
Cert Guide on IP troubleshooting  – If there’s a chapter about troubleshooting routing, glean
tips like using ping and traceroute  to find where connectivity stops, and checking routing
tables. 
HSRP Configuration Guide (Cisco)  – Skim for context: just see sample config and how routers
form active/standby. Not needed to memorize, but helpful if you attempt the optional lab.

Cisco: “Introduction to Routing”  – a beginner-friendly article on how routers route. Could be on
Cisco Learning Network. 
RFC 5798 (VRRP)  – not to read fully, but maybe the intro and motivation for VRRP (open standard
alternative to Cisco’s HSRP). 
Network Computing: “FHRP Comparison”  – an article or blog comparing HSRP, VRRP, GLBP in
terms of what they do. Since GLBP (load balancing gateway) is Cisco-proprietary and interesting,
note how it differs. 
Troubleshooting Static Routes  – A support forum or blog scenario where static routes were
misconfigured (e.g., wrong next-hop, missing route on one side, etc.), and how it was diagnosed.
This  will  give  insight  into  common  pitfalls  (like  forgetting  a  route  back  causing  one-way
communication). 
Online Courses:
Cisco NetAcad – SRWE Module 6: Static Routing  and Module 15 (or ENAUTO content) on FHRP
(if any). NetAcad has a lab “Configure Static Routing” – do it. Also, they might have a Packet
Tracer for HSRP. If yes, try it. 
Lab Practice  – Some websites (like Free CCNA Workbook) have static routing labs. Use those
descriptions to set up scenarios. 
Packet Tracer Challenge  – Use PT’s Activity Wizard or find some PT activities shared online for
static routing challenges (like a troubleshooting scenario where you must add missing routes). 
Hands-On Labs/Projects:
Lab 7.1: Static Routing Basic  – Create a topology of 3 routers in a chain (R1—R2—R3) with three
networks: network A between R1 and R2, network B between R2 and R3, and a loopback or LAN
off R1 and R3 each to simulate end networks. Without dynamic routing, configure static routes
so that: R1 knows how to reach R3’s LAN, R3 knows how to reach R1’s LAN, and both use R2 as
next hop. Also R2 needs routes to both LANs (or use default routes strategically). Expected
Outcome:  End devices on R1’s LAN can ping end devices on R3’s LAN. Test by pinging across and
possibly traceroute to see the path. Document the routing table of each router ( show ip 
route output) to confirm the routes. 
Lab 7.2: Static Route Failover (Floating Static)  – Modify Lab 7.1 by adding a redundant link:
e.g., a direct link between R1 and R3 (so we have two paths between R1 and R3: one via R2, one
direct). On R1, set a primary static route to R3’s LAN via R2. Then set a floating static  (higher AD)
via the direct link. Do the inverse on R3. Test: when everything up, traffic goes via R2 (check
traceroute). Shut down the R1-R2 interface to simulate failure; traffic should reroute via direct
R1-R3 link thanks to the floating static. Expected Outcome:  You see failover in action with static
routes (this parallels what dynamic routing or FHRP would do automatically). This solidifies
understanding of AD (administrative distance) and backup routes. 
Lab 7.3: HSRP Configuration  (optional if time and interest) – If Packet Tracer supports HSRP on
routers (it does on multilayer switches for sure, routers maybe), set up two routers both
connected to a LAN (e.g., PC, Switch, and two routers all in VLAN 10). Configure HSRP on the
routers for that VLAN10 network: give them a virtual IP as default gateway for the PC. Make one
router active with higher priority. Observe that the PC’s default gateway is the virtual IP, but it’s
being served by Router1. Then shut Router1’s interface and see Router2 take over (PC should still
ping out, perhaps to a simulated internet cloud or another network). Expected Outcome:  The
PC doesn’t lose connectivity when the primary gateway router goes down – HSRP provides
redundancy. Use show standby  on routers to see HSRP status. •

Lab 7.4: Troubleshoot Static Routes  – Intentionally break something in a static route setup:
e.g., omit a route on one of the routers and see how ping fails one direction. Practice diagnosing:
use ping, then traceroute , then check routing tables, then fix route. Document this
process as if writing a troubleshooting ticket resolution. 
(Design Exercise) Default Gateway Redundancy Plan:  Write a small memo for a hypothetical
network: two edge routers serving a network. Propose which FHRP to use (say VRRP if multi-
vendor or HSRP if Cisco-only) and why. Outline the config steps at high level. This isn’t execution
but demonstrates you understand the problem FHRPs solve and how you’d apply it. 
Quizzes/Assessments:
Static Routing Quiz:  ~10 questions: covering syntax ( ip route  command format), how to
interpret a routing table entry, the effect of AD, and maybe a simple scenario question (“PC can’t
reach server , which static route is missing?”). 
FHRP Quiz:  ~5 questions: mostly conceptual – “What does HSRP provide?”, “Which FHRP is Cisco-
proprietary vs open?”, “How does a host use HSRP – what IP does it have as gateway?”, etc. 
Subnetting/IP review:  Include a few questions to keep subnetting fresh (never stop practicing!).
e.g., “Which of these is a valid /30 network address?” or “You need at least 100 hosts, which mask
do you choose?” 
NetAcad Chapter quiz  for static routing (if using NetAcad). 
Continue Anki: static vs dynamic routing definitions, HSRP default port (maybe not needed, but
could note HSRP uses virtual MAC starting with 0000.0C07.ACxx – trivia that might appear),
command for floating static route (just adding AD at end), etc. 
Time Allocation (~12 hours):
- Videos: ~2 hours (routing fundamentals, FHRP)
- Reading: ~2 hours (Cert guide static route chapter , FHRP sections)
- Labs: ~6 hours (static route labs, including failover scenario and possibly HSRP)
- Quizzes/Flashcards: ~2 hours (analysis of mistakes, reviewing tricky parts like VLSM or static route
recursion if any) 
Milestones & Checkpoints:
-  Milestone  1:  Configure  static  routes  on  a  multi-router  topology  and  demonstrate  end-to-end
connectivity. Provide a screenshot of  show ip route  from each router with explanations of each
route entry (e.g., “S 10.1.1.0/24 [1/0] via 10.2.0.2” means a static route to network 10.1.1.0 with AD 1 via
next-hop 10.2.0.2). Explaining the routing table cements your understanding.
- Milestone 2:  Achieve a successful static route failover test (if attempted): demonstrate via traceroute
or ping that traffic reroutes when primary path is down. This shows grasp of AD and backup routes.
- Milestone 3:  Be able to describe how HSRP/VRRP works without notes. For example: “HSRP: two or
more routers form a group with a virtual IP; one is active (forwarding) with virtual MAC, another is
standby; if active fails, standby takes over virtual IP/MAC so hosts don’t notice.” If you can say that,
you’re set for CCNA-level FHRP knowledge.
- Milestone 4:  Static routing quiz score ~100% (it’s a small topic, aim to perfect it), FHRP quiz ~80%. If
any confusion remains (like difference between GLBP vs HSRP), clarify now.
- Checkpoint:  You’ve laid the groundwork for dynamic routing. Static routes are fine but imagine doing
that for 50 routers – not scalable. You should be eagerly anticipating how a protocol like OSPF will
automate route distribution – that’s next week. Also ensure you haven’t lost touch with switching:
maybe in labs you combined VLANs with routing (router on stick is static route case). If not, maybe
quickly review your inter-VLAN lab to see static routes in action (the router had connected routes for•

VLANs; static routes might have been used on switches if L3 switch, etc.). Everything’s building up. On to
OSPF!
Week 8: OSPF – Single-Area Configuration and Theory
Objectives (Week 8):
- Learn what  OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)  is and why dynamic routing protocols are needed.
Understand  OSPF’s  general  characteristics:  link-state  protocol,  uses  Dijkstra’s  algorithm,  forms
adjacencies with neighbors, floods LSAs.
- Know OSPF terminology:  Router ID ,  Area  (focus on single-area OSPF, typically Area 0 only in CCNA
scope), DR/BDR  on multiaccess networks like Ethernet , metric  (cost, based on bandwidth).
-  Configure  single-area  OSPFv2  on  Cisco  routers :  using  router ospf <process-id>  and
network  statements, or interface ip ospf  method. Practice a basic OSPF setup on a multi-router
topology and verify adjacency formation ( show ip ospf neighbor ) and routes ( show ip route
showing OSPF routes).
- Handle OSPF attributes: set the Router ID manually (and know auto-selection rules), observe that OSPF
chooses a DR/BDR on broadcast networks (maybe simulate with 3 routers in one LAN).
- Basic OSPF troubleshooting: e.g., mismatched subnet masks or areas causing no adjacency.
- Cover OSPF for IPv6 (OSPFv3) conceptually – CCNA may not heavily test it, but know that OSPFv3 exists
and is similar but separate process for IPv6. If time, configure one OSPFv3 instance for practice.
- Emphasize that OSPF is a key CCNA topic – possibly multiple exam questions, so spend ample time to
master fundamentals. 
Resources:
- Videos/Tutorials:
- Jeremy’s IT Lab Day 14 & 15 – OSPF (Parts 1 & 2)  (YouTube, ~30 min each) – These cover OSPF basics,
configuration, neighbor relationships, etc., in CCNA-focused detail . Jeremy often includes lab
demos.
- Keith Barker “OSPF Basics”  (YouTube, ~20 min) – Great conceptual explanation using whiteboard –
covers what LSAs are, basic link-state idea, without diving too deep (CCNA doesn’t require LSA types
memorization, but concept of link-state flooding is good to know).
-  NetworkChuck “OSPF in 7 Minutes”  – Quick high-level recap or introduction to get the gist (as a
supplementary resource to keep it fun).
- David Bombal Lab on OSPF  (if available on YT, e.g., “CCNA OSPF Lab Packet Tracer”) – Following along
a lab step-by-step can reinforce config and verification commands.
- (Optional) “OSPF Neighbor States”  – if you want to go beyond, some videos explain the states (Down,
Init, 2-Way, Exstart, Exchange, Loading, Full) – but at CCNA, just knowing Full adjacency and maybe 2-
Way for DROTHERs is enough. If curious, watch a short explanation. 
Books/Chapters:
CCNA Cert Guide (Vol. 2)  – Read the OSPF chapter very thoroughly. It likely covers single-area
config, OSPF operation concepts, neighbor relationships, and troubleshooting tips. Make sure
you understand how OSPF identifies neighbors (by matching area, authentication (if any),
subnet, hello/dead timers, etc.). For CCNA, main things: matching subnet mask and area must
match for adjacency; router ID selection (highest loopback IP or highest active IP if no manual
ID); the concept of DR/BDR on multiaccess networks – only one DR/BDR per network segment to
reduce adjacencies. 
Any included labs or examples in the text – do them or simulate them in Packet Tracer as you
read. 
“OSPF LSA Types Simplified”  (if in text or an appendix) – not required to memorize types, but
reading a summary might help you understand how OSPF shares info (Link State29

Advertisements). CCNA might have a question like “Which routing protocol floods link-state
advertisements?” or “Which routing protocol uses cost as metric?” which you should easily
answer by now. 
If you have a lab manual or guide , see if there’s an OSPF exercise; doing more than one OSPF lab
is useful. 
Research Papers/Articles:
RFC 2328  – OSPFv2 Specification (again not to read fully, but maybe the intro and rationale). The
first paragraph often states it’s a link-state routing protocol using SPF algorithm. 
“OSPF Neighbor Troubleshooting Checklist”  (Cisco Support) – gives common reasons two
OSPF routers won’t form adjacency (e.g., area mismatch, IP mismatch, passive interface, etc.).
Keep this as a reference to troubleshoot your labs if needed. 
PacketLife OSPF Cheat Sheet  – a one-page summary of OSPF, might list LSA types, state
machine, etc. Good for quick review or to see the big picture. 
Cisco Design Guide excerpt  – maybe a section about when to use single-area vs multi-area
OSPF (CCNA doesn’t require multi-area config, but understanding that large networks can be
segmented into areas is good). 
(Industry) “Why  OSPF  is  widely  used”  –  a  blog  or  article  extolling  OSPF’s  scalability,  fast
convergence, etc., compared to, say, RIP (which is outdated). Just to reinforce you’re learning a
relevant protocol. 
Online Courses:
Cisco NetAcad – Enterprise Networking, Security & Automation (ENSA) v7  likely has OSPF in
depth. If available, do Module on OSPF (single-area). They will have Packet Tracer labs like
“Configure Single-Area OSPFv2” and maybe an OSPF troubleshooting PT. Do these. 
Boson NetSim (optional)  if you have it or similar simulation with guided labs, try an OSPF lab
scenario. 
GNS3 labs (optional)  – If you want more realism, you could try a GNS3 or CML lab for OSPF, but
Packet Tracer suffices for CCNA-level OSPF. 
Hands-On Labs/Projects:
Lab 8.1: OSPF Basic Configuration  – Use a 3 or 4-router topology (could reuse static routing lab
but remove static routes). Configure OSPF on all routers in Area 0. You can use the network
commands (e.g., network 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.255 area 0  to cover certain ranges, or identify
each interface). Ensure all routers become neighbors (use show ip ospf neighbor ). Assign a
Loopback interface on one router to observe how OSPF advertises it (it should appear as O IA or
O route in others if not area 0? Actually in single area it’s just O). Expected Outcome:  All routers
have routes to all networks via OSPF in their routing tables. Test connectivity across the network.
Lab 8.2: OSPF Router ID and Neighbor Relationships  – In the above lab, set router IDs
manually ( router-id X.X.X.X ) that are easy to identify (e.g., 1.1.1.1 for R1, etc.). Reload
OSPF (clear process) so they take effect. Observe neighbor outputs listing these IDs. Then
simulate a multiaccess segment: e.g., connect 3 routers to a single switch (or multi-point cloud)
to simulate them on the same Ethernet. See in show ip ospf neighbor  which one is DR,
BDR, DROTHER – by default highest router ID becomes DR. Try changing OSPF priority on one
router to make it DR. Expected Outcome:  Understanding of DR/BDR election – only DR and BDR•

24

show full adjacency with all, others (DROTHER) have 2-way with each other but full only with DR/
BDR. For CCNA, just know conceptually, but seeing it is nice. 
Lab 8.3: OSPF Passive Interface and Default Route  – Take one of your routers (like an edge
router) and configure a default route (maybe to a fake internet cloud or a stub network) and
inject it into OSPF (using default-information originate ). Make some interface passive
(like LAN interfaces that shouldn’t form OSPF neighbor). Ensure OSPF still advertises the
connected networks but doesn’t try to neighbor on passive interfaces. Expected Outcome:  Your
internal routers receive a default route from OSPF (marked as O*E2 usually), and you
understand passive-interface usage (security and efficiency to not send hellos on e.g. user LANs).
Lab 8.4: OSPFv3 for IPv6 (optional)  – If eager , configure OSPF for IPv6 on a dual-stack network.
Even if just between two routers. This uses ipv6 ospf  commands on interfaces and router 
ospf <id> ipv6 . Verify with show ipv6 ospf . Not heavily needed for CCNA, but one lab
helps reinforce OSPF knowledge and demystifies IPv6 routing. 
(Project) OSPF Study Notes  – Create a one-page “OSPF cheatsheet” in your own words: including
OSPF  message  types  (Hello,  LSU,  LSA  concepts),  neighbor  requirements,  OSPF  metrics  and
default reference bandwidth, and common show commands and their meaning. This act of
summarizing will prepare you for any exam question on OSPF as you’ll have organized the info
yourself. 
Quizzes/Assessments:
OSPF Concepts Quiz:  ~15-20 questions. Cover OSPF basics: e.g., “What algorithm does OSPF
use?” (SPF/Dijkstra), “How does OSPF elect DR?” (highest router ID or priority), “Which multicast
addresses does OSPF use for updates?” (224.0.0.5, maybe too deep for CCNA, but possibly trivial
Q), “What’s the default OSPF cost of a 100Mb link?” (1, since reference BW 100 Mb), etc. Mix
concept and config questions. 
OSPF Configuration Quiz:  ~5 questions focusing on interpretation: e.g., given partial show 
running-config , does OSPF appear correctly configured? Or “Which command verifies OSPF
adjacencies?” (show ip ospf neighbor vs show ip route ospf). 
Troubleshoot scenario Q:  maybe a question: “Router A OSPF config has area 0, Router B has
area 1 on their connected link – will they form adjacency?” (Answer: No, area mismatch). Include
one or two like that. 
Review of older topics:  a few questions from switching or static routing just to keep them fresh.
Perhaps “What does a switch do if it doesn’t know destination MAC?” or “Which command on a
switch enables you to see if a port is in err-disabled state?” (to recall STP maybe). 
Flashcards: Expand OSPF deck – e.g., “Default OSPF Hello interval on Ethernet? (10s) Dead
interval? (40s)”, “OSPF AD? (110) vs EIGRP AD (90) vs static (1) – a bit of comparative knowledge
helps.”, “Neighbors not forming – check area, masks, timers, auth, MTU”. Reviewing these
regularly will make OSPF second nature. 
Time Allocation (~14 hours):
- Videos: ~3 hours (OSPF requires some time to digest)
- Reading: ~3 hours (this is a heavy chapter likely; do it in segments)
- Labs: ~6 hours (multiple OSPF labs as described; OSPF often requires tweaking and wait times for
convergence, so be patient)
-  Quizzes/Review:  ~2  hours  (going  through  multi-choice  and  verifying  against  labs/reading  for
correctness) 
Milestones & Checkpoints:
- Milestone 1:  Configure a multi-router OSPF network and achieve full connectivity without any static•

routes. Provide evidence: e.g., ping from one end to the other  and the routing table from a router
showing OSPF-learned routes. If you trust OSPF’s routes and they match expectations (correct subnets
and next hops), you did it right.
- Milestone 2:  Demonstrate understanding of OSPF neighbor relationships. For instance, intentionally
misconfigure a parameter (like area) to see adjacency fail, then correct it. Or identify in a multiaccess
network which router became DR and why. Jot down a brief explanation of OSPF neighbor states and
roles in your notes (even if CCNA doesn’t test state names deeply, the process of explaining helps).
- Milestone 3:  Score at least ~75-80% on OSPF quizzes. OSPF has nuance, so if you miss some, focus on
those  topics  again.  Key  point:  You  should  be  comfortable  with  reading  an  OSPF  config  and
understanding what each part does (network statements, router-id, etc.), and interpreting show ip 
ospf neighbor/route  outputs. If any output line confuses you, clarify it now (like OSPF route codes:
O = intra-area, O IA = interarea, E1/E2 = external – CCNA mostly single area so probably O routes only).
- Checkpoint:  With OSPF covered, you have tackled the most complex part of CCNA routing. Ensure you
also recall earlier routing topics: difference between OSPF and RIP/EIGRP (just basics: OSPF link-state vs
RIP distance-vector), but note EIGRP is not in CCNA anymore aside from a mention. Double-check IP
Connectivity blueprint: we’ve done static, OSPF, FHRP. The blueprint also lists understanding  routing
table components  and forwarding decision process , which we’ve done. Also, first-hop redundancy (done
conceptually). At this stage, you can route within and between networks pretty proficiently! Month 3 is
not over – we’ll now apply this in context of IP services.
Week 9: IP Services – DHCP , NAT, and Network Services
Objectives (Week 9):
- Understand and configure DHCP  (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) on Cisco devices : both
DHCP server (on a router or multilayer switch) and DHCP relay (IP Helper). Know the DHCP process
(DORA: Discover , Offer , Request, Ack) and what information is provided (IP, subnet mask, gateway, DNS,
etc.).
- Set up  NAT (Network Address Translation)  on a router for IPv4: specifically  PAT (Port Address
Translation)  for allowing multiple internal hosts to share one public IP (this is the typical use case). Also
know static NAT (one-to-one) usage and configuration. CCNA expects you to configure and verify NAT in
IOS.
- Learn about  NTP (Network Time Protocol)  and configure a router or switch to use NTP client
mode (sync with a server) and potentially act as NTP server for others. Understand the importance of
time sync in networks (for logging, certificates, etc.).
- Cover SNMP and Syslog  concepts  – possibly configuration basics: setting up a SNMP community
on a router , and logging to a syslog server . We might not do deep labs on these, but at least know how
to verify and the purpose (monitoring, network operations).
-  Introduce  QoS  basics  (Quality  of  Service):  know  what  QoS  is  for  –  to  prioritize  certain  traffic.
Specifically, CCNA might mention classification and marking (DSCP values) and queueing strategies –
just theoretical understanding. Possibly see how a router shows QoS config, but configuration likely not
required.
- Summarize IP Services domain topics and ensure each is touched: DNS  (role in network – not config on
router , but know it translates names and often there’s a “ip name-server” command to allow router to
resolve  names),  FTP/TFTP  uses  (for  file  transfer  e.g.,  router  IOS  upgrade  via  TFTP) ,  and  SSH
configuration on Cisco devices (we did some in earlier labs implicitly, but ensure you can configure a
router/switch for SSH access).

- Jeremy’s IT Lab Day 19 – DHCP  (YouTube, ~20 min) – likely covers DHCP concepts and a Packet Tracer
demo.
- “NAT Explained + Config”  by NetworkChuck (YouTube, 15 min) – Chuck shows inside/local vs outside/
global, typically with coffee shop analogy, then does a PAT config. Good for beginners to catch the idea.
- Jeremy’s IT Lab Day 20 – NAT  (YouTube, ~30 min) – thorough NAT config demos including static, PAT,
verification ( show ip nat translations  etc.).
- “NTP and Syslog”  (CBT Nuggets or Pluralsight snippet, ~10 min) – explaining how to set timezone, NTP
server , and how syslog logging levels work. If not accessible, try a YouTube video on “Configuring NTP
on Cisco” (plenty of free ones, ~5 min).
- (Optional) “SNMP Basics”  by Professor Messer (Network+ video, ~5 min) – covers SNMP v2 vs v3 basics
and how SNMP is used. Enough for concept. 
Books/Chapters:
CCNA Cert Guide (Vol. 2)  – It will have chapters on IP Services. Read sections on: DHCP (how to
configure a DHCP server on IOS, and DHCP relay agent using ip helper-address ), NAT
(inside/outside concepts, static vs pool vs PAT configuration, and common show commands),
NTP (simple client config), DNS (just that a router can be a DNS client or we can use “ip host” to
map names, etc.), SNMP (just overview of community strings and basic SNMP operations GET/
SET), Syslog (levels 0-7 and how to set logging). QoS likely has a short section – focus on
understanding classification, marking (like DSCP), and trust boundaries in a campus (maybe
beyond CCNA but just in case). 
Lab Manual / 31 Days  – likely has a day for NAT and one for DHCP. Go through those for more
practice questions. 
Cisco Press articles  – often there are short guides like “NAT Fundamentals” on Cisco website.
Use if you need alternate explanation, especially the NAT address terminology. 
Research Papers/Articles:
RFC 2131  – DHCP protocol (just read a bit of intro if curious; know it’s UDP 67/68 for exam
possibly). 
Cisco Docs: “Configuring Network Address Translation”  – covers IOS commands and
examples for static NAT, PAT, etc. 
“Troubleshooting NAT”  article – common NAT issues (like not clearing NAT translations after
config changes, or forgetting ACL for NAT if needed). Might not be needed if labs go smooth, but
good reading. 
NTP.org brief  – maybe a page explaining NTP strata, but CCNA probably won’t ask that. However ,
note NTP uses UDP 123, maybe an exam trivial. 
SNMP vs Syslog  – an article explaining how they differ for network monitoring. 
QoS Basics  – Cisco has a doc “IP QoS Intro” or search for “DiffServ QoS tutorial” to get the idea of
what classification and PHB mean  (this correlates to blueprint mentioning PHB for QoS). 
Online Courses:
Cisco NetAcad – ENSA Modules  likely cover NAT (there’s a known PT lab “Configure PAT”) and
DHCP (“DHCP server PT activity”). Do those labs from NetAcad if you have them. They also cover
NTP and maybe QoS basics. 
Skillsoft/Pluralsight  – if you have access, maybe one of their CCNA courses has a quick lab on
DHCP and NAT. Not required, but extra perspective if needed. •

Try HackMe / Packet Tracer mini-games  – not sure if any gamified content for these, but
running through config is straightforward enough. 
Hands-On Labs/Projects:
Lab 9.1: DHCP Server and Relay  – Take a router (or switch) as central and two networks: e.g.,
Router with two LAN interfaces: one LAN has a router directly connected to PCs, another LAN
maybe behind a switch. Configure one router as DHCP server  for both networks (two pools). For
the network where router isn’t directly connected (say a router connected to another router
which connects to PCs), use DHCP Relay: on that intermediate router interface, configure ip 
helper-address <DHCP-server-IP> . Test from PCs: they should get IPs in correct ranges
along with gateway (the router) and DNS if configured. Expected Outcome:  PC on each network
receives valid IP config via DHCP. Use show ip dhcp binding  on server to verify leases. 
Lab 9.2: NAT/PAT Configuration  – Create a scenario: Router with an “inside” network (e.g.,
192.168.10.0/24 with a couple PCs) and an “outside” network (simulate the internet or a stub
network with a server , using, say, 203.0.113.0/24). Configure PAT on the router so that all inside
addresses can share the router’s outside IP. On PCs, set their gateway to the router inside IP. Test
by pinging the “internet” server from a PC. It should work if NAT is correctly translating. Do 
show ip nat translations  to see the dynamic entries (you’ll see inside local, inside global,
etc.). Also test something like port translation by maybe using a simulated service if possible, but
ping should suffice. Optionally, configure a static NAT  for one inside host (like make one PC
reachable from outside on a static mapping). Try accessing it from the “outside” side. Expected
Outcome:  Internal PCs reach outside resources with NAT functioning, and any static NAT
mapping works for inbound. 
Lab 9.3: NTP and Syslog  – If you have an accessible NTP server (maybe Packet Tracer can
simulate one, or use router as NTP master), configure routers to sync time. E.g., one router as
NTP master (or actual public NTP if PT supports sending to an address but likely not), others as
clients. Use show clock  to verify time sync. For Syslog, perhaps set up one router as a syslog
receiver by using a loopback as the “syslog server” (PT might not simulate an actual syslog server
application, but you can at least set logging <ip>  on devices). At minimum, configure
logging host on a router and generate some log (like interface up/down) to see if you get a
message (in PT maybe use simulation mode to see syslog packet). If not possible, conceptually
ensure you know how to do it. 
Lab 9.4: SNMP (optional)  – Configure a simple SNMP community on a router ( snmp-server 
community PUBLIC RO ) and use a PC with a network monitoring tool (PT might not have that)
– if not, skip actual test, just know the config. 
Lab 9.5: End-to-End Network Build  – As a final project for Month 3, build a small company
network: 2 departments on separate VLANs (use a switch and router-on-stick or multilayer
switch for inter-VLAN), include a DHCP server for clients, use NAT on the edge router to an “ISP”,
run OSPF on internal routers if multiple. Also implement an ACL (access control list) as a simple
firewall to allow internal to outside, but block certain port maybe (we’ll do ACL more next week,
but you can preview). Essentially, combine multiple technologies into one coherent network.
Document the network diagram and configurations as if preparing for a handover to another
engineer . Expected Outcome:  A multi-faceted network that mirrors a simplified enterprise:
VLANs, routing (static or OSPF), NAT for internet, DHCP for hosts, etc. This is a synthesis exercise
and also good practice for the capstone next month. 
(Project) Documentation  and  Diagrams:  Take  one  of  your  recent  labs  (like  the  NAT/DHCP
network) and create a professional-looking network diagram using a tool (Lucidchart, draw.io, or
even  Packet  Tracer’s  drawing  tools).  Label  VLANs,  IPs,  device  names.  Write  a  brief  network•

documentation  (couple  paragraphs)  describing  the  topology  and  addressing  scheme.  This
practices the soft skill of documentation – very important for a network engineer . 
Quizzes/Assessments:
DHCP/NAT Quiz:  ~15 questions. Example topics: DHCP message sequence, function of DHCP
relay, configuring DHCP pool options (like default-router command), NAT inside vs outside
meaning, how PAT differentiates flows (port numbers), identify NAT addresses given a translation
(inside local/global definitions), etc. Possibly a scenario: “Host can’t get DHCP address – which
command is missing?” or “After configuring NAT, inside hosts still can’t reach out – what could be
wrong?” (like forgot ACL for NAT, or mis-set inside/outside interface). 
Services Quiz:  ~10 questions covering NTP (purpose, maybe which stratum or which port),
SNMP (which version is secure? v3), Syslog (which level is Emergency? difference between level 0
and 7), QoS (maybe one question: “What does QoS classification mean?”). 
Security intro Quiz:  Because next week is Security, maybe preview with a couple of simple Qs
now: e.g., “What is the purpose of an ACL?”, “Which command enables SSH on a Cisco
switch?” (for review if you did it), just to start thinking on security. 
Flashcards: Summarize NAT types, default ports for services (FTP 21, SSH 22, etc – not sure if
CCNA requires memorizing many ports, but a handful of common ones is good), syslog levels (0
Emergencies, 7 Debug), SNMP vs Syslog uses, and QoS terms (like congestion avoidance vs
congestion management, again maybe beyond CCNA detail). 
Time Allocation (~13 hours):
- Videos: ~2 hours (services configs)
- Reading: ~3 hours (multiple small topics to cover)
- Labs: ~6 hours (lots of practical configuration this week)
- Quizzes/Review: ~2 hours (covering various services, which might be lighter individually but many
topics) 
Milestones & Checkpoints:
-  Milestone 1:  Configure a DHCP server on a router and verify clients get addresses. Show a sample
client IP config (from  ipconfig  in PT PC or just show dhcp binding) and ensure gateway/DNS is
correctly  delivered.  If  something  failed,  note  how  you  fixed  it  (e.g.,  forgot  the  default-router
command initially).
-  Milestone  2:  Implement  PAT  and  demonstrate  an  inside  host  reaching  an  outside  host.  Use
show  ip  nat  translations  to  present  one  example  of  a  translation  (e.g.,
192.168.10.5:12345 -> 203.0.113.2:randomPort ).  Be  able  to  explain  which  is  inside  local/
global . If static NAT, show that outside can reach inside using the static mapping.
- Milestone 3:  Set up NTP in lab or at least configure ntp server x.x.x.x  on a router . Confirm time
sync (maybe use  debug ntp  if possible or  show ntp associations ). If not feasible, state the
commands used and expected result.
- Milestone 4:  Write down in your notes an “IP Services summary” covering DHCP (ports 67/68, DORA),
NAT (terms and commands), NTP (basics of client/server), SNMP (v2c vs v3), Syslog (levels 0-7), TFTP/FTP
use cases, and SSH vs Telnet difference. This is your cheat-sheet for quick recall.
- Milestone 5:  Achieve 80%+ combined on the services quizzes. These are straightforward if you labbed
– e.g., NAT can be confusing but if you practiced, it’s okay. Clarify any missed concept by re-reading that
bit of Odom or using device outputs to understand.
-  Checkpoint:  Now  the  core  network  engineering  skills  are  in  place  –  you’ve  handled  network
fundamentals, switching, routing, and essential services. The remaining blueprint domains are Security
and Automation, which we’ll cover in Month 4 and 5, along with lots of review and practice. Reflect on
how many configs you can now do: from VLANs to OSPF to NAT. That’s huge! Ensure all your lab files•

and notes are organized – you might start revisiting them for exam review soon. Take a well-earned
break and gear up for Security topics next.
Motivation:  Three months down – you’re halfway through the timeline and have covered the lion’s share
of technical topics. It’s normal if some things still feel complicated (OSPF or NAT confusions linger), but
you have time to refine via reviews and more practice. The key is: you’ve built a robust foundation . In
the next months, we’ll reinforce it with advanced topics and lots of reviews. Keep pushing forward;
you’re doing fantastic. Also, maybe start engaging with others (online forums, study groups) to test
your knowledge by answering questions – teaching is a great test of mastery. On to Month 4!
Month 4: Security Fundamentals and Advanced Networking
Focus:  Month 4 addresses the  Security Fundamentals (15%)  domain and ties up any leftover core
topics. We will cover device security (passwords, AAA concepts), Layer 2 security (like port security,
DHCP snooping) and wireless security. We’ll also introduce some automation basics (to prep for Month
5) and do heavy review  this month – mock tests and revisiting weak spots. By the end of Month 4, you
should have touched all exam topics at least once. Domains covered:  Security Fundamentals (CCNA 5.0)
and parts of Automation/Programmability (basic intro). Plus ongoing review of earlier domains.
Week 10: Device Security and Access Control
Objectives (Week 10):
- Learn about  basic device hardening : setting strong  passwords  (console, VTY, enable secret) ,
using password policies (minimum length, complexity, etc.) , and the importance of disabling unused
services. Configure these on a lab router/switch.
- Understand AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting)  concepts : not configure in depth
(that’s CCNP), but know that AAA can use local or external (RADIUS/TACACS+ servers). Understand how a
Cisco device can use a central server to authenticate admins. Possibly configure a simple local AAA
authentication for login as practice.
- Configure  SSH on a Cisco device: generate RSA keys, set up username/password or AAA, and verify
SSH login. Ensure Telnet is disabled (only SSH allowed).
- Implement Port Security  on a switch : limit MAC addresses on a port (e.g., only allow one MAC and
shutdown if violation). Test by connecting a different device to see the violation.
- Implement ACLs (Access Control Lists)  on a router : Standard ACL vs Extended ACL differences.
Practice creating a standard ACL to filter traffic (e.g., block one network from accessing another) and an
extended ACL (e.g., permit HTTP but block Telnet). Apply ACLs inbound or outbound on interfaces
appropriately and test.
- Understand ACL best practices  and how they’re used for security (basic firewalling) and for control
plane (e.g., line VTY ACL to limit who can SSH).
- Cover Device login banners  (MOTD) for legal warning, and the concept of physical security (briefly).
- This week is heavy on configuration – it solidifies as you do it practically. 
Resources:
- Videos/Tutorials:
- Jeremy’s IT Lab Day 4 Lab – Basic Device Security  (YouTube, ~10 min) – likely covers setting console/
VTY passwords, service password-encryption, etc., which you did partly in Month1 but review now with
security lens.
- Keith Barker “SSH Configuration”  (YouTube, 8 min) – quick steps to enable SSH on a Cisco router/
switch.
-  NetworkChuck “Port Security”  (YouTube, 10 min) – demonstration of setting up port security and44

showing what happens on violation (with his typical energetic style, possibly caffeinated example).
- CBT Nuggets “Standard vs Extended ACL”  (if access, ~10 min) – explains the difference and perhaps a
scenario of each. Otherwise, try a free video by David Bombal on configuring ACLs.
-  Kevin Wallace “ACL Wildcard Masking”  (YouTube, 5 min) – understanding wildcard masks in ACL
(inversion of subnet mask). Many beginners find wildcard confusing, so ensure you get it.
-  (Optional) “AAA and RADIUS/TACACS+”  (Network Direction on YT, ~15 min) – to conceptualize AAA.
CCNA might only ask e.g., “What is an advantage of TACACS+ over RADIUS?” or “Which port does
RADIUS use?” – maybe too deep, but know TACACS+ is Cisco, TCP, encrypts full payload; RADIUS is UDP,
encrypts only password. Minor details. 
Books/Chapters:
CCNA Cert Guide (Vol. 2)  – Read the Security Fundamentals chapter(s). Key topics: securing
device access (passwords, SSH), Layer 2 security (port security, DHCP snooping, DAI), basics of
VPNs (definition of site-to-site vs remote access) , and intro to AAA. Odom likely also covers
device monitoring (like SNMP which we did) and an intro to network attacks (DoS, phishing, etc.)
– know basic definitions of threats  and mitigations. Also read about ACLs  thoroughly –
standard ACL (numbered 1-99 or named), extended ACL (100-199 or named), and where to place
them (standard close to destination, extended close to source typically). 
Ensure to cover Layer 2 security : Odom will mention DHCP Snooping, ARP Inspection, Port Security
as in blueprint . Understand what each does: DHCP Snooping prevents rogue DHCP servers;
DAI relies on snooping to block fake ARP; Port Security limits MACs to prevent CAM table
overflow attacks. 
There might be mention of WLAN security  here (blueprint has WPA/WPA2/WPA3) – recall from
earlier and know the differences (WPA2 uses AES-CCMP, WPA3 adds SAE, etc., but just basics). 
Possibly an overview of  Network Attack types  – e.g., VLAN hopping, spoofing, man-in-the-
middle, etc., with mitigations. If present, read to be able to name a few common ones. 
Research Papers/Articles:
Cisco Guide: “Configuring Secure Management Access”  – covers SSH setup, role-based CLI
maybe. Focus on SSH and strong passwords parts. 
Cisco Port Security Best Practices  – find an article listing recommendations (like stick to one
MAC per port for user ports, use violation shutdown). 
SANS paper on ACLs  – possibly, or just recall from earlier reading. 
Common threats  – maybe a blog “Top 5 network attacks and how to prevent” to broaden your
understanding: e.g., MAC flooding (countered by port security), DHCP spoofing (counter by
DHCP Snooping), ARP poisoning (counter by DAI), etc. 
Cisco Whitepaper: “Network Security Fundamentals”  – if any summary doc exists. Might
reinforce CIA triad concept (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) – not sure if CCNA explicitly
covers that, but could mention if context arises. 
Online Courses:
Cisco NetAcad – ENSA Module on Network Security : They have chapters on Access Control,
perhaps AAA, VPN overview, etc. Do any Packet Tracer labs on ACLs (there’s often a PT “Configure
and Verify ACLs”). 
Packet Tracer Activities  – Check PT for pre-made activities like “Port Security” or “Secure
Network Device” – sometimes there are. •

Cybrary/Free Cybersercurity content  – if you want more theory, but for CCNA probably not
needed beyond core principles. 
Hands-On Labs/Projects:
Lab 10.1: Secure Management Config  – Take a lab router/switch, configure: an enable secret,
local user account with privilege 15, console login using local, VTY login using local with
transport input SSH only, generate RSA keys, and test SSH from a PC. Also set service 
password-encryption  (so your line passwords are encrypted in config). Finally, set a login
banner (MOTD). Expected Outcome:  You can only access the device via SSH with the correct
user/pass, and console also requires login. The config should show encrypted passwords.
Document these steps as if making a checklist (will be useful later). 
Lab 10.2: Port Security Demo  – On a switch, pick an access port connected to a PC. Configure 
switchport port-security  (default allows one MAC) and maybe violation shutdown .
Connect the PC, see it works. Now disconnect that PC and connect a different device (or change
the MAC in PT by replacing the NIC or using another PC). The port should go into err-disable.
Check show port-security interface X  to see the violation count. Then re-enable the
port ( shutdown/no shutdown ) and possibly set it to violation protect  mode to see
difference (in protect, won’t shut, but drops unknown MAC traffic). Expected Outcome:
Understanding how port security can block devices beyond the first. 
Lab 10.3: ACL Practice  – a) Standard ACL : On a router with two subnets (A and B), create a
standard ACL to block traffic from one specific host or subnet A from reaching subnet B. Apply it
inbound on interface toward B. Test with pings: the blocked host should fail, others succeed. b) 
Extended ACL : e.g., block HTTP from one network to a server , but allow other traffic. Use an
extended ACL applied appropriately. Alternatively, implement an ACL on VTY lines to allow only a
specific IP range to telnet/SSH to the router (for management plane security). Expected
Outcome:  You can write ACL statements (with correct wildcard masks, host vs any keywords)
and apply them correctly (right interface, right direction) to achieve desired filtering. Use show 
access-lists  to see hit counts after tests. 
Lab 10.4: Layer 2 Security  – If Packet Tracer supports, try enabling DHCP Snooping  on a switch
(specify trusted ports vs untrusted) and then simulate a rogue DHCP (PT might not easily
simulate rogue server , but you can place a second DHCP server in a VLAN and see if snooping
blocks it). Similarly, DAI needs ARP packets – may skip actual test, but know config. If not
feasible, at least review how to enable those (e.g., ip dhcp snooping  globally and per VLAN). 
Lab 10.5: Wireless Security  – On a wireless router/AP in PT, try setting different security modes
(WEP, WPA2, etc.) to see how a client connects with each. Note how a weak security (like WEP)
could be cracked (just conceptually). If possible, show that without knowing passphrase, client
can’t connect – obvious, but demonstrates necessity of proper Wi-Fi auth. 
(Project) Security Audit Checklist:  Create a checklist for securing a small network device: e.g., “1.
Set enable secret, 2. Disable unused ports or put in unused VLAN, 3. Apply port security on
access ports, 4. Use SSH not Telnet, 5. Use strong passwords and maybe AAA, 6. Implement ACLs
to limit access to network segments, 7. Enable logging and NTP for time sync (for accurate logs),
etc.” This can be compiled from Cisco best practices. Use this list to verify your own labs have no
glaring holes. 
Quizzes/Assessments:
Device Security Quiz:  ~10 questions – e.g., “Which command encrypts all plaintext passwords in
config?” (service password-encryption), “What does AAA stand for?”, “What is the default violation
mode of port security?” (shutdown), “How many MACs by default if not specified?” (1), etc. •

ACL Quiz:  ~10 questions – test understanding of wildcards (like “Which wildcard matches
192.168.5.0/255.255.255.0?” answer 0.0.0.255), order of ACL, extended ACL format (src/dst IP and
ports), maybe identify what an ACL will do from lines given. 
Security Concepts Quiz:  ~10 questions – cover general: difference between threat, vulnerability,
exploit ; VPN types  (just definition of site-to-site vs remote-access), wireless security
differences, AAA differences (TACACS+ vs RADIUS), maybe one on CIA triad or social engineering.
Previous domains mixed quiz:  Add 5-10 questions from routing/switching to keep memory
fresh (maybe you can take a small mixed practice test from a site/book). 
Flashcards: Terms to memorize: e.g., “DHCP Snooping – prevents rogue server”, “port security
default aging: what? (by default secure MAC doesn’t age out unless configured)”, “Standard ACL
range (1-99)”, “Extended ACL range (100-199)”, “Well-known ports: 20/21 FTP, 22 SSH, 23 Telnet,
53 DNS, 69 TFTP, 80 HTTP, 443 HTTPS, 161 SNMP, etc., to answer any odd question or just to
know for ACL port filters)”. Also maybe “WPA3 uses SAE (Dragonfly handshake)”. 
Time Allocation (~13 hours):
- Videos: ~2 hours
- Reading: ~3 hours (security chapters)
- Labs: ~5-6 hours (multiple short config labs)
- Quizzes/Review: ~2 hours 
Milestones & Checkpoints:
- Milestone 1:  Harden a device and verify: e.g., a switch that only allows SSH login with a specific user ,
and has console secured. Attempt to telnet (should fail), attempt SSH with wrong user (fail), right user
(success). If possible, get a peer to try to “break in” (or just simulate by trying defaults) to ensure it’s
secure.
- Milestone 2:  Successfully use port security to shut down a port on unauthorized device connection.
Check that you know how to bring it back ( errdisable recovery  or manual shut/no shut).
-  Milestone 3:  Implemented ACLs that work as intended. Document one example: “Standard ACL 10
blocking Network X applied on interface G0/0 inbound blocked traffic successfully as shown by ping
tests.” Also note ACL best practice (like placing, and remember implicit deny at end).
-  Milestone 4:  Quick-fire: be able to answer “How to mitigate X?” for the common threats: e.g., MAC
flooding -> Port Security, rogue DHCP -> DHCP Snooping, ARP Poisoning -> DAI, brute-force on device ->
strong passwords & login delay, etc. You don’t need to know deep, just a one-liner mitigation.
- Milestone 5:  Achieve ~80% across security quizzes. If there’s any term or tech you missed, review it.
For instance, if you blanked on “what does SNMPv3 add” (security), just note it down. If ACL logic
confused you (like order of lines or implicit deny), clarify with more practice.
- Checkpoint:  At this point, you have completed an initial pass through all CCNA domains . Congrats!
You likely have a pile of notes, lab configs, and flashcards. For the remainder of Month 4 and in Month
5, we’ll focus on  automation  plus heavy  review and practice exams  to solidify everything. Use this
checkpoint to identify your weakest areas – maybe it’s OSPF, or ACLs, or subnetting under time. Flag
them for extra attention in coming weeks. 
Motivation:  Security can be detail-heavy, but you’ve grasped how to lock down a network which is a
critical skill. It’s satisfying to break and then secure something. Remember , skills like ACLs and port
security are not only exam topics but practical tools  – your future network engineer self will thank
you for mastering them now. Keep those study habits strong; you’re in the home stretch of content
coverage.  Month  5  will  introduce  the  final  piece  (Automation)  and  then  it’s  all  about  integrating
knowledge and practice tests.•

Week 11: Automation & Programmability Fundamentals
Objectives (Week 11):
- Grasp why network automation  and programmability are emerging: the need for scale, consistency,
and integration with DevOps. Understand terms like SDN (Software-Defined Networking)  – separating
control plane and data plane, and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)  – how software can interact
with network devices.
- Learn about REST APIs  in the context of networking: e.g., Cisco’s RESTful APIs (like those on Cisco
DNA Center or even some on IOS-XE). Understand what CRUD means (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
and that these map to HTTP verbs (POST, GET, PUT/PATCH, DELETE).
- Get exposure to data formats like  JSON  (JavaScript Object Notation) and maybe XML – CCNA
expects you to recognize JSON output and basic structure (key:value pairs, nested). Practice reading a
JSON snippet and locating a piece of data (like an IP address in a JSON of interface info).
- Explore  network automation tools : Know of Puppet, Chef, Ansible (just what they are, not how to
use) . Ansible is popular for network automation (YAML playbooks). Puppet/Chef are more used in
server world but Cisco wants you aware.
- Basic scripting intro: write a very simple  Python script  to retrieve or configure something, or just
parse some output. If you’re new to coding, at least understand a provided Python script that uses a
library like netmiko  or requests to call a REST API. We won’t become coders in a week, but break the
ice.
- Use Cisco’s DevNet resources if possible: maybe use the Cisco DevNet sandbox or their always-on
sandboxes for DNA Center or CSR1000v API to try a sample API call (alternatively, use Packet Tracer’s
new REST-based multiuser feature if exists, or just conceptual).
- Tie back to exam: ensure you can answer conceptual Qs like “What is the benefit of controller-based
networking?” , “What is an example of southbound API vs northbound API?”  (Southbound: e.g.,
OpenFlow, NETCONF; Northbound: REST API to controller). Recognize JSON and interpret it.
- This week is more about reading/understanding than heavy lab, unless you’re comfortable to try some
coding. 
Resources:
- Videos/Tutorials:
-  Cisco DevNet “Networking 101: APIs”  (YouTube, ~10 min) – an explanation by Hank Preston or
similar about using APIs in network management.
- NetworkChuck “REST APIs for Beginners”  (YouTube, 15 min) – not network specific, but covers what
an API is in simple terms, using maybe a public API example.
-  David Bombal “JSON and Postman for CCNA”  (YouTube, ~20 min) – David often covers new CCNA
topics; he may have one showing how to use Postman (an API client) to query a Cisco controller and get
JSON data. This could be very practical to watch.
- “SDN and Controllers”  by Keith Barker (YouTube, ~12 min) – conceptual explanation of SDN and Cisco
DNA Center as an example, plus traditional vs SDN differences.
- CBT Nuggets “Automation and Programmability Basics”  (if access) – might have a high-level video
summarizing these emerging tech within CCNA scope.
- (Optional) “Python for Network Engineers Crash”  (YouTube, e.g., by Kirk Byers or others, 1 hour or
more) – only if you have time/interest to go deeper . Focus on simpler: how to open a SSH connection
with netmiko, or parse an IP from a text using Python regex. But that may be beyond what’s needed. 
Books/Chapters:
CCNA Cert Guide (Vol. 2)  – The last chapter(s) on Automation & Programmability. Read all
sections: Network Architectures (controller-based vs traditional), APIs (northbound/southbound),
configuration management tools (just understand they manage configs and ensure desired108

state), Cisco DNA Center & SD-Access overview (fabric, overlay/underlay concepts from blueprint)
, JSON data format (they might show an example and point out how to pick values) . 
There might also be mention of model-driven programmability (YANG models, NETCONF) – just
note those words, maybe one exam Q. 
Cisco DevNet Assoc. book  (if any excerpt is available) – might have overlapping content with
CCNA automation section for deeper interest. 
Appendix or Additional Reading:  Odom might reference some DevNet resources; check if any
recommended reading on JSON or APIs. 
Research Papers/Articles:
Cisco Whitepaper: “Intent-Based Networking”  – describes concept behind controllers like DNA
Center (which uses intent-based policies). Good to get buzzwords like “intent, automation,
assurance”. 
Blog: “APIs for Network Engineers”  – a blog by a network engineer who learned Python,
explaining how they use REST APIs to get device info. 
JSON tutorial  – lots online, but maybe an interactive one where you view a JSON example. If not,
even Wikipedia JSON page shows an example to interpret. 
DevNet “Hello Network!” lab  – if you register on Cisco DevNet (free), they have some guided
labs on using sandbox. Maybe try “REST API Basics” or “Always-On Sandbox demo”. 
OpenFlow overview  – just read what OpenFlow is historically (protocol for controllers to
program switches – used in early SDN, now not as talked, but part of history). 
Terraform/Chef/Puppet  – no need detail, just know these are Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools,
beyond CCNA likely. 
Online Courses:
Cisco NetAcad – DevNet Associate course  (if available, not sure if free). If accessible, might
have beginner labs on using Postman to query Cisco DNA. 
Postman or curl practice : If you have access to a network device with API (maybe PT doesn’t
have, but you could install Cisco Packet Tracer and see if it supports some API?), alternative: use
a dummy public API (like a weather API) in Postman just to get comfortable with GET/POST and
see JSON. 
Coding practice : if new to Python, perhaps use an interactive site like Codecademy for a couple
of Python lessons just so you can read code. But time is short; if you already code a bit, maybe
attempt something small like using Python to read a JSON file. 
Hands-On Labs/Projects:
Lab 11.1: Explore a REST API  – Use a tool like Postman (install on your computer) or Python 
requests  library to GET data from an API. If you don’t have a Cisco device API, use something
like httpbin or a dummy JSON API. Alternatively, many Cisco devices have an HTTP interface you
could enable (not secure, but for test). If you can, enable REST API on a DevNet sandbox or
CSR1000v VM (this might be advanced – if not, skip doing it yourself). At least, open a sample
JSON file (maybe Odom’s book has one, or find on DevNet) and try to pick out key info. Expected
Outcome:  You understand how an API call returns structured data (JSON) and how it differs
from CLI show output. 108 65

Lab 11.2: Simple Python Script  – Write or copy a short script that does something like “print all
IP addresses in this JSON” or “SSH to router and run show ip int brief (using netmiko)”. If you’ve
never coded, ask a programmer friend or find a ready script from DevNet Code Exchange.
Running it successfully and seeing output is the goal. If not comfortable, at least go through the
thought: how would automation save time vs manual CLI (imagine configuring 100 VLANs on 10
switches – script can do it faster with less error). 
Lab 11.3: Controller Demo  – If possible, watch a demo or recording of Cisco DNA Center or
Packet Tracer’s SDN Controller (PT has a “Controller” object for SDN but not sure how functional).
At least conceptually: one central controller can push VLAN configs to all switches or do dynamic
path optimization. Recognize how this differs from logging individually. 
Lab 11.4: JSON Parsing Exercise  – Create a small JSON structure (or use sample) that includes
network info, e.g.: {"interface": "Gig0/1", "ip_address": "10.0.0.1", "status": 
"up"}. Write down how you’d access the IP address field (answer: by key "ip_address"). Maybe
test with a Python one-liner if possible: import json; data=json.loads(<jsonstring>); 
print(data["interface"])  to print values. Expected Outcome:  Not to memorize syntax but
to demystify JSON (it’s just text with keys/values, often easier than parsing CLI output). 
(Project) Automation Strategy Proposal:  Imagine you manage 50 switches – list 3 tasks you
would  script/automate  (e.g.,  backup  configs  nightly,  bulk  update  SNMP  community,  verify
interfaces up). For each, describe how automation helps (less error , schedule it, etc.). This isn’t on
exam, but thinking this way prepares you for real network engineering in modern environments
and gives context to why Cisco added this domain. 
Quizzes/Assessments:
Automation Concepts Quiz:  ~10-15 questions. Cover north vs southbound API, e.g., “Which is a
southbound API? a) REST to DNA Center , b) NETCONF to routers, c) web dashboard GUI
(northbound example).” Ask about benefits of automation (fewer errors, consistency, speed).
Maybe “Which data format is easiest for machines to parse? JSON vs XML vs YAML – arguably
JSON/YAML both fine, but JSON is ubiquitous). Some basic Python logic like “which of these is a
correct list syntax in Python?” or maybe not – CCNA not a coding test but might have pseudo-
code trace (but rarely). If any question, likely identify JSON vs XML or a Python snippet output.
For instance, they may show a JSON and ask “what is the value of X key?” – test if you can read
JSON. Or a Python print(data["ip"])  and ask what it does (print the value of "ip" key from
data dictionary). If you’ve done above exercises, you’d get it. 
DevOps Tool Quiz:  ~5 questions – maybe matching “Puppet/Chef” to “uses declarative manifests
and agent on nodes” vs “Ansible uses SSH, agentless, uses YAML playbooks” vs “SaltStack, etc.” If
CCNA doesn’t go deep, maybe one question: “Which tool uses a push model? (Ansible) vs pull
model (Puppet)”. But likely just identify these as automation/config management tools. 
Full-length Practice Exam #1:  This is a good point to take a full CCNA practice exam  (60-70
questions, 2 hours). Use Boson ExSim if you have it (highly recommended ) or the Cisco
Official Practice if available, or a free one (ExamTopics – but caution, verify answers). Simulate
exam conditions: 120 min timer , no notes. Afterward, grade and analyze every question , especially
the ones you got wrong or guessed. This will highlight any weak areas to focus on in Week 12
and Month 5 review. 
Continue Flashcards: add any new ones (like “API = Application Programming Interface, allows
software to communicate via defined requests”, “CRUD = Create,Read,Update,Delete”, sample
JSON syntax). Also maybe flashcard any facts you got wrong in practice exam. By now, flashcards
should be a sizable deck – keep doing daily reviews; it’s a great retention tool up to exam day. •

Time Allocation (~12 hours):
- Videos: ~2 hours
- Reading/learning: ~3 hours
- Hands-on (if doing script/API calls): ~3 hours (maybe more if really diving, adjust as needed)
- Practice Exam and review: ~4 hours (2h exam, 2h review) 
Milestones & Checkpoints:
-  Milestone  1:  Write  a  short  explanation  (4-5  sentences)  of  the  difference  between  traditional
networking vs controller-based. E.g., “Traditional: each device configured individually (CLI), control plane
distributed; Controller-based: central brain (controller) tells devices how to forward, devices are simpler ,
easier to enforce policies network-wide.” If you can articulate that, you got the core idea .
-  Milestone  2:  Interpret  a  given  JSON.  For  instance,  take:  {"device": {"name": "R1",  
"interfaces":  [{"name":  "Gig0/0",  "ip":"10.0.0.1"},
{"name":"Gig0/1","ip":"10.0.1.1"}]}} . Answer: how many interfaces does R1 have and what
are their IPs? (Should be: 2 interfaces, IPs 10.0.0.1 and 10.0.1.1). If you can do that, you’re good for JSON
interpretation .
- Milestone 3:  (Optional but cool) Successfully run a simple network automation action – whether it’s an
API GET retrieving something or using a script to login and run a command. If accomplished, celebrate
– you’ve stepped into netprog! If not, at least know what such a script would generally look like.
- Milestone 4:  Complete the full practice exam and identify improvement areas. Suppose you scored,
say, 70% – not bad for first full attempt; list which sections had wrong answers. Make a plan to review
those (which we’ll do Week 12 and Month 5). If you scored 90% – great, but still review any misses and
note if it was luck on some guesses; ensure those are solidified.
-  Checkpoint:  Content  learning  phase  is  nearly  done.  All  topics  are  covered.  The  focus  shifts  to
reinforcing knowledge, practicing scenarios, and test readiness . Compare where you were at Month
1 vs now – impressive progress, right? The next step: refine until you’re consistently exam-ready and
confident  in  practical  skills  too.  Use  Month  5  for  that  polishing,  plus  a  capstone  project  to  apply
everything.
Motivation:  Automation is a new frontier – don’t worry if you felt like a newbie again here. The CCNA only
dips a toe into programmability; mastery comes with practice over time. The key takeaway is you now
know what’s possible  and won’t be intimidated by terms like JSON or API in the field. Embrace a growth
mindset – network engineering is evolving and so are you. Now, let’s gear up for the final phase: intense
review, practice tests, and a big capstone lab to ensure you’re more than ready for the exam and the job
market.
Week 12: Comprehensive Review and Mock Exam
Objectives (Week 12):
- Systematic review  of all domains: Each day of this week, focus on one domain’s key points and “must-
know” facts/configs. E.g., Day1: Network Fundamentals recap, Day2: Network Access recap, etc. Use
your notes, flashcards, and maybe re-watch 2x speed videos or skim chapters to reinforce.
- Identify and fill any remaining gaps: If certain labs were skipped or still shaky (maybe IPv6 or OSPF
area type details), address them now with quick labs or reading.
- Take at least one more full-length mock exam  (preferably a different set of questions than week 11’s).
Aim to exceed the passing score margin (target ~90% so you have cushion).
- Practice Simulations and practical scenarios : If you have access to simulation-style questions (like
configuring  something  under  time),  practice  a  couple.  If  not,  create  your  own  mini-scenarios  to
configure without looking at guides (like: “Configure OSPF on these routers, with passive interface on
LAN, and default route advertisement – go!” and see if you can do it quickly).
-  Refine  test-taking  strategies:  manage  time  (approx  1  min/question,  more  for  sim),  flag  tough110
65
37

questions and move on, eliminate wrong answers in MCQs by logic, etc. Train your brain to stay calm
and methodical during the exam.
- Ensure you are ready with practical skills as well: though CCNA is theory + some sim, for job readiness,
ensure you can do the common tasks without peeking at notes now.
- By end of week, be exam-ready and also ready to apply knowledge in a capstone project next month. 
Resources:
- Videos:
- Watch any “Last minute CCNA review” videos (there are often 1-2 hour marathon reviews on YouTube
summarizing key points). E.g., “CCNA in 120 minutes” type videos – good for high-level catch-all revision.
- Exam tips videos  (many CCNA mentors have “tips to pass” with advice on question wording, how to
not overthink, etc.). This might ease anxiety and give insight on Cisco’s style.
- If certain topics still fuzzy, revisit those specific video sections at higher speed for clarity. 
Reading:
Skim through your compiled notes and highlight anything you’d hesitate on if asked outright. If
you find any, clarify immediately (look up that detail). 
Re-read the exam blueprint list we compiled at the beginning. Can you give a sentence or two
about each sub-bullet if asked? If not, review those. 
If you have the Odom books, the end-of-book “Key Topics” and “Do I Know This Already” quizzes
are excellent for quick review. Use those as a checklist. 
Practice exams:
Boson ExSim – do Exam B (if you did A earlier) under exam conditions. Review thoroughly. 
Pearson/Cisco Official Practice exam (if you have it). 
Take some free online quizzes for variety (careful with brain dump sites; better use reputable
ones like Todd Lammle’s site or others with practice Qs). 
If scoring consistently ~85%+, that’s a good sign. If below ~80%, identify why – content gap or
tricky wording? Fix content gaps and practice interpreting wording (dissect what the question
really asks). 
Lab practice:
Quickly lab any config that you don’t feel second-nature: e.g., “Setting up trunk + EtherChannel”
quickly, or “One static NAT and one PAT” quickly. This just builds muscle memory and confidence.
If possible, do a timed lab: e.g., give yourself 30 minutes to configure a small network from
scratch (3 routers OSPF + 2 VLANs + NAT, etc.). This isn’t for exam (they won’t be that extensive
due to time), but for you to consolidate integration of topics. 
Ensure you know how to verify and troubleshoot in labs swiftly: e.g., commands like  ping, 
traceroute ,  show ip int brief ,  show cdp neighbors , etc., should come to mind
easily to diagnose things, because some exam sims might require troubleshooting a misconfig. 
Flashcards:
By now you have many flashcards – keep reviewing daily, but also start trimming ones you
always get right (or mark them as known). Focus on ones you still slip on. •

The day before exam (in plan, that’s next month), you might just skim through all to ensure
nothing forgotten. 
Health/Mental Prep:
This is part of review week too: Plan your exam logistics (if you intend to take it right after Month
5, schedule it now so you have a date !). Having it scheduled will drive you. 
Ensure you get good rest and not burn out this week – if you study too hard without breaks,
retention drops. Take short breaks, stay hydrated, exercise a bit. 
Practice some mindfulness or positive visualization: imagine opening your exam result with a
pass – that’s motivating and calms nerves. 
Milestones & Checkpoints:
- Milestone 1:  Score well on Mock Exam(s). For instance, if Boson exam gives scores per section, ensure
none of the six domains is below ~80%. If one is, revisit that domain’s content until you can raise it.
-  Milestone 2:  Conduct a thorough  self-assessment : Print out (or write down) each exam blueprint
topic and rate your confidence 1-5. For any 3 or below, do a targeted review. After review, all should be 4
or 5 (meaning “I could answer an exam question or do a basic lab on this”).
- Milestone 3:  Complete a final lab or troubleshoot challenge without hints, successfully. For example,
purposely break something in a network (like an OSPF area mismatch or an ACL blocking a service) and
see if you can find and fix it quickly. This shows you can apply knowledge dynamically, which is great for
job skills.
- Milestone 4:  Organize your study materials for next month’s capstone and job prep: e.g., have your
best notes and diagrams ready to refer to when designing the final project and for interview prep (it’s
handy to show or at least talk about a project with documentation).
- Checkpoint:  You should now feel ready to schedule or soon take the CCNA exam . If not, identify what’s
holding you back – content, test anxiety, etc. This plan assumed exam after 6 months; if you’re ahead of
schedule and feel ready now, you could even take it earlier . If not, adjust plan to do more practice where
needed. The key is mastery and confidence. 
Motivation:  You are basically at the summit of CCNA preparation. The view is great – look back at all the
concepts you’ve mastered! This week’s intense review might be tiring, but think of it as polishing a gem:
you’re  refining  rough  edges  so  you  can  shine  on  exam  day.  Keep  the  momentum  but  also  start
envisioning life post-exam (the next section will help with that – job prep, etc.). Remember , the goal is
not just to pass an exam, but to become a capable network engineer , and you’re well on your way. 
Month 5: Final Prep, Capstone Project, and Exam Readiness
Focus:  Month 5 is about  consolidation and application . We will integrate everything in a realistic
capstone project , do last-mile prep with mock exams and flashcards, and finally take (and pass!) the
CCNA exam likely in Week 4 or end of this month. Post-exam, we’ll transition to job preparation tasks. (If
you plan to take the exam in Month 6 instead, you can adjust accordingly, but this plan assumes by end
of Month 5 you attempt the exam). 
Week 13: Capstone Network Design Project – Plan
Objectives (Week 13):
- Begin a  capstone project : designing a small enterprise network from scratch, incorporating most
technologies  learned.  This  week,  focus  on  planning  and  design  on  “paper”  (or  software)  before
implementation next week.
-  Scenario:  You are tasked to design a network for a small company with, say, 3 departments (like• 
• 
• 
71
• 
• 
39

Admin, Engineering, Sales), two sites (HQ and Branch), and internet connectivity. They require: VLANs
per  department,  inter-site  routing,  internet  access  for  all  via  HQ,  secure  remote  access  for  a  few
employees (VPN), and basic network security measures.
- Create a  network diagram  of this topology: likely includes routers at each site, switches, maybe a
firewall (optional, or use router ACL as firewall), an ISP cloud, and maybe a server network.
- Plan IP addressing: assign subnets to each VLAN and site, ensuring summarization if possible and
avoiding overlaps. Perhaps use private IPs internally and one public range for NAT at HQ.
- Choose and justify routing: e.g., use OSPF between sites (maybe over a simulated WAN), static default
to internet, etc. - Plan out where to apply security: e.g., port security on user ports, ACL on router to
filter internet traffic, VPN using perhaps Packet Tracer’s VPN feature (if any, else just conceptual).
- Essentially, write a network design document : including network requirements, IP scheme, device
roles, protocols, and security measures.
- Get feedback if possible: if you have a mentor or friend in networking, show them the design for
critique. If not, self-review by comparing to reference architectures from Cisco (e.g., Enterprise Network
Model). 
Resources:
- Reference Designs:
- Cisco Validated Designs or CCNA case studies. Perhaps Cisco Press CCNA books had a final chapter
with a case study network – use that as inspiration or reference.
- The old “Hierarchical Network Model” (Core/Dist/Access) – since we have HQ and Branch, maybe HQ
has a core switch and some access switches. Use two-tier design (collapsed core) given small size.
- Subnet calculators  (to double-check your addressing plan efficiency).
- Visio or draw.io stencils  – for making a nice diagram. (Or Packet Tracer’s built-in drawing for a quick
visual). 
Design considerations:
VLAN for each department (plus maybe a management VLAN, and a VLAN for voice if any VoIP –
optional). 
Redundancy: maybe not a huge network, but could have two switches at HQ with EtherChannel
and HSRP for gateway redundancy as a bonus. If it complicates, keep it smaller . 
Branch could be simpler (one router , one switch). 
WAN link: simulate maybe as a serial or just an IP cloud. If using PT, can connect routers via
cloud or directly. 
Security: plan where to put an ACL (likely on HQ router outbound to internet to restrict certain
traffic, and inbound from internet to allow only VPN or necessary). 
VPN: If PT supports GRE or IPsec, perhaps plan an IPsec tunnel between HQ and Branch or for
remote user – if not, just state it. 
Automation: not required in design, but you can mention future plan to use Ansible for
consistency. 
Milestones & Checkpoints:
- Milestone 1:  Complete a network diagram  of the proposed design, showing all subnets and VLAN
IDs, device names, interfaces, and relevant IP addresses. This is the blueprint for your implementation.
-  Milestone 2:  Write out the  IP addressing plan : e.g., “192.168.10.0/24 – Admin VLAN 10 at HQ (50
users), 192.168.20.0/24 – Eng VLAN 20 at HQ (30 users), 192.168.30.0/24 – Sales VLAN 30 at HQ (20
users), 192.168.40.0/24 – Branch office LAN (30 users). WAN: 10.0.0.0/30 between HQ and Branch.”
Ensure the sizing fits (no VLAN has more IPs than needed but leave some growth).
- Milestone 3:  Enumerate the technologies to use: “OSPF area 0 between HQ and Branch routers; Inter-
VLAN routing via multilayer switch at HQ or router-on-a-stick; PAT on HQ router for internet; Port
security on access ports (max 2 MAC for phones+PC maybe); DHCP from HQ server/router; ACL on HQ•

router to block certain ports (e.g., disallow telnet from outside); Site-to-site VPN planned (conceptual).”
This list will guide config.
-  Checkpoint:  Validate the plan against CCNA topics: did you include at least something from each
domain?  Likely  yes:  VLANs  (Network  Access),  OSPF  (IP  Connectivity),  NAT/DHCP  (IP  Services),  ACL/
security (Security Fundamentals), maybe mention of automation (like “we will use SSH and maybe
network scripts for config backup” for Automation, albeit light). The aim is to demonstrate holistic
understanding.
- Next step will be implementing and testing this design in Week 14.
Motivation:  Designing a network from scratch is the ultimate test of understanding – it forces you to
consider how pieces fit together . Don’t worry if you have to adjust along the way (that’s normal). Enjoy
this creative and analytical process – it resembles real job tasks. You’re effectively acting as a network
engineer/architect now, which is exactly the outcome we wanted. Take pride in that!
Week 14: Capstone Network Implementation and Test
Objectives (Week 14):
- Implement the designed network in Packet Tracer (or real gear if accessible) step-by-step.
- Configure VLANs and trunking at HQ, set up inter-VLAN routing (either a layer 3 switch SVIs or a
router-on-a-stick). Configure OSPF between HQ and Branch routers, ensure routes exchanged.
- Set up DHCP server (maybe at HQ for all subnets, using DHCP relay to branch). Set up NAT on HQ for
internet access simulation (use a loopback or cloud as Internet).
- Apply security: port security on switches, ACL on HQ router for traffic filtering, secure device configs
(SSH login). If possible, configure an IPsec VPN between HQ and Branch (PT might have a “VPN easy”
option on routers – if not, simulate by just allowing direct since it’s lab).
- Test end-to-end: from a PC in each VLAN, ping others, ping branch, ping internet (maybe simulate
internet as a server in a different network beyond HQ router). Test fail-safes if any (e.g., if you did HSRP
with two routers at HQ, shut one to see continuity).
- Troubleshoot any issues encountered – this is likely. It’s part of learning: maybe OSPF adjacency fails
due to passive interface or NAT issues. Work through them systematically (like you would on exam sims
or real world).
- Once stable, document the configuration : save config files, and perhaps write an executive summary
of the network to accompany the diagram.
- This project is also material you can mention in interviews or on a resume (it’s home lab, but it shows
initiative and skills). 
Resources:
-  Packet Tracer : Use PT’s multi-tab to keep track of different config sections (and it allows notes on
topology).
- Prior labs : You basically will reuse many configurations from prior weeks but combined. Refer back if
needed (no shame in checking a command if memory is unsure – in real world you’d check docs – but
try to recall first).
- Peer review : if you know someone else in CCNA, maybe share your Packet Tracer file for them to test,
and vice versa. Fresh eyes might catch config mistakes. 
Milestones & Checkpoints:
- Milestone 1:  All critical configs done: VLANs, OSPF, NAT, DHCP, ACLs, port security. The network should
be functioning as intended. For example: Users get IP via DHCP, can reach resources in other VLANs and
branch, internet pings go out (maybe not real internet but a fake server), and disallowed traffic is
indeed blocked by ACL.
- Milestone 2:  Testing results documented. Make a table: each VLAN PC -> where should it reach and
41

not reach? Test ping/HTTP etc. E.g., “PC in Sales VLAN -> should reach Branch server (ping ok), should
browse internet (http ok, tested by HTTP to fake server), should NOT telnet outside (tried telnet, blocked
as expected by ACL).” Do this for key scenarios. All tests should align with design goals.
- Milestone 3:  Configuration review: run show run  on each device and ensure no glaring issues (e.g.,
default  passwords,  missing  service  encryption,  etc.).  Also  note  resource  usage:  Did  you  use  small
subnets efficiently? Are there any routing table oddities? Clean up if necessary (like remove any test ACL
lines, etc.).
-  Milestone 4:  Save your final Packet Tracer file and also export configs (for your portfolio). Create a
brief  Network  Implementation  Report  with  the  diagram,  summary  of  addressing,  summary  of
protocols, and verification outputs (like OSPF neighbor table, NAT translation sample, etc.). Even if just
for yourself, this consolidates what you’ve built.
- Checkpoint:  Congratulate yourself – you’ve essentially simulated the job of setting up an enterprise
network! This capstone ties together months of learning. It should boost your confidence that not only
can  you  answer  exam  questions,  you  can  actually  apply  the  knowledge.  This  is  the  bridge  from
certification to real-world skill. Use this accomplishment as a talking point in interviews and as personal
validation of your abilities. 
Motivation:  Finishing a project like this is hugely satisfying. Think about how far you’ve come – from not
knowing what a VLAN or OSPF was, to now building a network with both. That’s tangible progress. If
parts  of  the  project  were  challenging,  that’s  good  –  better  to  face  challenges  in  practice  than  in
production. Now, any remaining focus can shift fully to exam-day readiness and job prep, knowing that
your skill foundation is strong.
Week 15: Final CCNA Exam Preparation and Rest
Objectives (Week 15):
-  Final exam prep : do a last round of practice exams or question banks focusing on weak areas
identified. If you have Boson Exam C or other sets, do them.
- Review flashcards or notes for anything that still trips you up. At this stage, avoid overloading on new
info; just solidify recall and understanding.
- Go over  exam-day logistics : Ensure you know location if in-person, or setup if online (test your
webcam,  internet,  clear  workspace  if  doing  online  proctored).  Have  two  forms  of  ID  ready.  Read
PearsonVue exam rules.
- Prepare mentally: in the last 1-2 days before exam, shift to light review and adequate rest . You won’t
gain much new knowledge cramming last minute, but you could tire yourself. Better to be fresh.
- Maybe skim through the official exam topics list one more time and say out loud or on paper the main
concept of each – if those come easily, you’re set.
- Plan to arrive early  if going to a center , or be set up early if online.
- Have a strategy: e.g., initial 10 seconds brain-dump on scratch paper (some do this for subnet table or
key acronyms – though some test centers might not allow writing until exam starts, check rules).
- Confidence: remind yourself of all the work put in. Some anxiety is normal, but trust your preparation.
You  have  consistently  scored  well  in  mocks  by  now  and  the  capstone  success  shows  deep
understanding.
- Exam Day:  Execute your plan calmly. Manage time – if a question is super confusing or long, mark and
move on, come back if time. Many find they have extra time at end because they practiced pacing. Use
any leftover time to review flagged questions.
- After submitting, breathe – you’ll see the result on screen. We expect a PASS!  If for some reason not
(stuff happens), analyze and you still have Month 6 to re-focus – but likely you got it.
- Celebrate achievement – it’s huge. Then short break and onward to job hunting prep. 
42

Resources:
- Test-Day tips articles  – e.g., “What to do on CCNA exam day” blogs, often recommending good sleep,
light meal, etc.
- Pearson Vue tutorial  – if you can find a preview of the exam interface (sometimes they have a generic
test tutorial), to know how sim questions look and how to answer drag-and-drop etc.
-  Online communities  – some people post their exam experience (without violating NDA). It can be
reassuring  to  read  a  few  “I  passed  CCNA,  it  was  easier/harder  than  I  thought”  just  to  calibrate
expectations, but don't let it spook you – everyone’s experience varies.
- Your support system  – whether friends or family, let them know you have the exam and maybe arrange
something fun after as a reward. 
Milestones & Checkpoints:
-  Milestone 1:  Achieve passing scores on final practice tests consistently (~85%+). If any domain still
lingers in 60-70%, do targeted quick refresh (e.g., re-read that chapter summary or watch a short video)
until you’re confident.
- Milestone 2:  Flashcards all green – by now, you might retire the deck, or just quickly flip through and
realize you know it all. If a few sticky points remain (like memorizing some numeric values or IEEE
numbers, etc.), decide if it’s worth last-minute memorizing. CCNA is more about understanding than
rote memorization (apart from subnetting maybe), so focus accordingly.
-  Milestone 3: Exam completed with passing score.  You’ll get a preliminary pass notification. Huge
moment! You can now proudly call yourself a Cisco Certified Network Associate. This is the culmination
of the 5 months of hard work.
-  Checkpoint:  With  the  exam  behind  you  (hopefully),  shift  mind  to  leveraging  this  cert:  updating
resume, sharing the news on LinkedIn, and preparing for job interviews. The final month will focus on
that transition.
Motivation:  This week is about keeping a cool head and trusting your journey. Confidence is earned, and
you’ve earned it. Imagine walking out of the testing center with a grin, or seeing “Congratulations!” on
the screen. It’s not luck – it’s your dedication paying off. And remember , even beyond the exam, the
knowledge stays with you. As the CCNA motto suggests, it’s not just a test, it’s training for your career .
Go get that cert!
Month 6: Post-CCNA Career Preparation
Focus:  With CCNA in hand, time to land that job! Month 6 (which might start immediately after passing
or overlap if you took exam in Month 5) is devoted to job search prep: polishing resume, practicing
interview questions (technical and HR), labbing any practical skills for interviews, and continuing to
learn (perhaps start looking at CCNA specialization or CCNP topics lightly, to discuss future plans in
interviews). 
We’ll break it into 4 weeks with tasks, but you can adjust based on your situation (you might already be
in a job and just need to leverage CCNA for promotion, etc.). We assume you’re seeking a network
engineer role or NOC/helpdesk that values CCNA.
Week 16: Update Resume and Online Presence
Objectives (Week 16):
- Update your  resume/CV : Highlight the CCNA certification (and mention knowledge of specific skills
from it). Also add any hands-on projects (like the capstone you did, home lab setups). Emphasize
practical skills: e.g., “Configured and managed VLANs, OSPF routing, and ACLs in lab environments.”
43

- If you have prior IT experience (even in helpdesk), tailor it to show networking exposure or relevant
problem-solving.
- Keep resume concise (1-2 pages), focus on skills and achievements. Possibly add a lab section or
personal projects section, since as a beginner that shows initiative.
- Create or update your LinkedIn : add CCNA cert (you can add via Cisco’s Cert manager to verify). Write
a  bio  that  you  are  a  certified  network  engineer  excited  about  networking.  Connect  with  people
(recruiters, network engineers, people from local Cisco user groups).
- Clean up your online presence (if any professional footprint beyond LinkedIn) – ensure your LinkedIn
photo is professional, and no inappropriate public posts elsewhere that employers might see.
-  Consider  creating  a  portfolio  site  or  GitHub:  maybe  upload  some  sanitized  lab  configs  or
documentation, or a blog post about your study journey. This isn’t required, but can set you apart if you
enjoy writing or sharing knowledge.
- Have someone review your resume (a mentor , friend in industry, or even use a free online resume
critique service if available). Feedback ensures it’s clear and impactful. 
Resources:
- Resume templates  – find a clean, modern template if you want a refresh. Avoid overly fancy graphics;
ATS (applicant tracking systems) prefer straightforward formatting.
- LinkedIn examples  – look at profiles of other CCNAs or entry-level network engineers to see how they
present themselves.
- Cisco’s Talent Network  – maybe sign up or see what they list as desired skills; incorporate keywords
(like “Cisco routers, switching, troubleshooting, TCP/IP, etc.”) into your resume so automated filters
catch them.
-  Professional photo  – if you don’t have one, have someone take a clear headshot of you in business
casual.
- Cert verification  – Cisco has a verification tool; you may get a PDF certificate and ID – mention the ID on
resume or just say “Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA), attained [Month Year]”. 
Milestones:
-  Milestone  1:  Finalize  resume  with  CCNA  included  and  at  least  one  project/experience  bullet
demonstrating networking skills. E.g., “Built a multi-site network in lab using OSPF and implemented
network security (ACLs, VPN)” – this is from your capstone. Even if lab, it’s relevant experience.
- Milestone 2:  Update LinkedIn profile to “Open to work” (if job hunting) and with CCNA credential. Post
an update about achieving CCNA – often that can get attention from connections and maybe recruiters
(plus congrats that make you visible).
- Milestone 3:  Ensure other sections are good: short summary in resume emphasizing you are eager to
apply networking knowledge, education updated (if you did any courses, mention Networking Academy
courses or self-study).
- Checkpoint:  You now have a professional presentation to the world as a network engineer . Next, we’ll
focus on preparing to deliver in interviews and assessments.
Motivation:  Marketing yourself might feel different from technical study, but it’s crucial. You earned a
valuable cert; don’t be shy to show it off in a polished way. A strong resume and LinkedIn can open
doors. Think of it as configuring yourself as the network device now – optimized for discovery by
recruiters!
Week 17: Common Interview Questions and Lab Drills
Objectives (Week 17):
-  Prepare  for  technical  interview  questions :  these  could  be  theoretical  (“Explain  OSPF  vs  RIP”),
scenario-based (“If a user can’t reach Google, how do you troubleshoot?”), or simple direct questions
44

(“What is a VLAN? What is subnetting and why is it useful? Describe the TCP handshake.”).
- Compile a list of ~20 common networking interview questions (Google “CCNA interview questions”).
Write out or speak your answers, ensuring clarity and confidence.
- Particularly focus on areas interviewers love: subnetting on the fly (they may ask you to calculate a
subnet or find a subnet ID quickly), troubleshooting approach, and basic definitions.
- Practice behavioral questions  too (STAR method: Situation, Task, Action, Result): e.g., “Tell me about a
time you solved a difficult technical problem” – you can use your labs or projects as examples (“I was
configuring  OSPF  and  neighbors  wouldn’t  form;  I  systematically  checked  parameters,  found  a
mismatch, resolved it – showing persistence and troubleshooting skills”).
- If possible, do a mock interview : have a friend pose as interviewer (preferably someone in IT) and run
through questions. Or record yourself answering and critically review (are you concise? Too nervous?
Using filler words?).
- Brush up on any tool or platform mentioned in job listings: e.g., some places might use Ticket systems
(like  ServiceNow)  –  be  ready  to  say  you  are  familiar  with  the  concept  of  ticketing;  mention
documentation skills (like using Notion or wiki as you did for notes).
- Revisit labs to ensure you can do simple tasks if asked on spot (some interviews might have a practical
test, like configuring a switch or writing an ACL). If you have access to Packet Tracer during an interview
or whiteboard, practice explaining your steps as you would if they watch you configure. 
Resources:
- Interview question lists:  Many blogs and YouTube videos list top CCNA or network engineer interview
questions. E.g., “What is the difference between a hub, switch, and router?”, “How does traceroute
work?”, “What is ARP?”, “Describe an IP routing process.”
- Glassdoor  – search for network engineer interviews at companies to see real questions they got.
- Mock interview services  – if you want professional help, some platforms connect you with industry pros
for mock interviews (sometimes paid).
- Friends or mentors  – if you know someone in networking, ask if they’d quiz you. They might throw in
curveballs which is good practice.
- Technical practice:  If expecting a technical test, review how to configure basics quickly. Possibly set a
timer for yourself to, say, assign IPs to interfaces and get OSPF running in 10 minutes. Speed isn’t
usually tested in interviews deeply, but you want to show you know your stuff without too much guess. 
Milestones:
-  Milestone  1:  Create  an  Q&A  list  with  answers  you're  happy  with  for  at  least  20  likely  technical
questions. For example, Q: “What’s the difference between TCP and UDP?” – A: “TCP is connection-
oriented, provides reliable delivery with acknowledgments and retransmission, used for things like web
browsing; UDP is connectionless, no guarantee of delivery, used for streaming or DNS where speed is
important.” Practice saying it aloud smoothly.
-  Milestone 2:  Successfully perform a mock troubleshooting scenario. E.g., friend says: “User can’t
access email.” You verbally walk through troubleshooting: “First, I’d ask if others are affected (scope).
Then check connectivity: ping user’s PC, gateway, etc. Check DNS if webmail. If network, could be an ACL
or route issue…” – show logical approach. The goal is to demonstrate you have a structured method, not
necessarily solve an unknown issue in real-time (they want to see your thinking).
- Milestone 3:  Identify any weak points that came up during practice. Perhaps you stumbled explaining
STP or forgot part of the OSI model. Quickly brush up on those now.
- Checkpoint:  By now, answering typical interview questions should feel much easier than before your
studies.  You  can  talk  about  technologies  confidently  and  also  showcase  critical  thinking  in
troubleshooting. This is crucial for convincing employers. Next, we’ll target job search and refining such
communication further .
45

Motivation:  Remember , an interview is as much about demonstrating your enthusiasm and thought
process  as it is about reciting facts. Given your preparation, you  know  the facts – now convey your
passion for networking and your problem-solving skills. Every question is an opportunity to show you’re
not just certified, but also a great colleague to work with (eager to learn, team-oriented, etc.). Practice
until you feel positive and ready for real interviews!
Week 18: Job Search and Applications Strategy
Objectives (Week 18):
- Identify target roles: network engineer (entry-level), network administrator , NOC technician, IT support
with networking focus, etc., ideally that list CCNA or similar as requirement.
- Use job boards (LinkedIn jobs, Indeed, Cisco’s own, local companies’ career pages) to find openings.
Aim to apply to multiple jobs per week – job hunting can be a numbers game.
-  Customize  your  cover  letter  (if  requested)  for  each  job  –  highlight  how  your  skills  match  their
environment  (if  they  mention  Cisco  ASA,  say  you  have  strong  Cisco  knowledge  and  are  learning
firewalls, etc.). If no cover letter , your resume should have keywords matching their needs.
- Use your network: reach out to any contacts in the industry. Let them know you’re CCNA certified and
looking for roles. A referral can often get your resume seen.
- Consider joining professional communities: e.g., Cisco Learning Network, local networkers meetup,
maybe user groups (even virtual). Sometimes job leads appear there.
- Prepare to discuss salary: research typical entry-level network engineer salary in your region. Have a
range in mind (don’t bring up unless asked, but be ready). With CCNA, you often have a bump over just
general IT tech.
- Keep learning lightly: as you apply, perhaps peek at CCNP topics or SDN trends – not to dive deep but
to show you’re forward-thinking in interviews (“I plan to pursue CCNP next” or “I’m also exploring
Python automation beyond CCNA”). This demonstrates initiative.
- Track your applications (perhaps in a spreadsheet or Trello) – company, role, date applied, status, so
you can follow up if needed and prepare for each interview specifically (research each company’s
network or business, so you can tailor answers).
- Don’t get discouraged by rejections or silence; it’s part of the process. Use any feedback to improve.
Celebrate small wins (like an HR screening call) as progress. 
Resources:
- Job postings:  Look at the requirements and responsibilities – note common themes (like maybe many
want knowledge of OSPF, BGP (even if you only know basics of BGP), VLANs, etc.). Make sure those
terms are on your resume if you have exposure (except don’t lie if you truly never touched something).
-  Cisco Networking Academy Alumni network  – sometimes NetAcad has partnerships or job boards for
alumni; check that out.
- Mentor advice:  If you have a mentor or someone who’s a network engineer , ask them to refer you or
guide you on entry points (e.g., maybe start at an ISP NOC which often hires CCNAs for network
monitoring – great learning environment).
- Recruiters:  Talk to IT recruiters; some specialize in networking roles. They can also give resume tips or
connect you with contract positions to get experience. 
Milestones:
-  Milestone  1:  Apply  to  at  least  X  jobs  this  week  (X  depends  on  availability,  maybe  5-10  quality
applications). Ensure each application you send has a tailored resume (if needed) and you follow any
instructions (some have questionnaires – answer carefully).
- Milestone 2:  Reach out to at least 3-5 professionals in networking – could be LinkedIn messages (e.g.,
“Hi, I just got my CCNA and am looking for entry opportunities; I admire your career path, any advice
you might share would be greatly appreciated.” – some might not reply, but some will and could offer
46

help). Also, don't hesitate to let friends know; sometimes opportunities come from casual connections.
-  Milestone  3:  Prepare  a  quick  “elevator  pitch”  for  networking  events  or  introductions:  “I  recently
became  CCNA-certified  and  built  extensive  home  lab  projects;  I’m  excited  to  start  a  career  in
networking,  particularly  in  network  support  or  junior  admin  roles  where  I  can  further  grow  and
contribute to a team.” This helps when speaking to recruiters or at job fairs.
- Checkpoint:  The job search might take weeks or a few months, but you’ve set it in motion. Keep up
momentum and while waiting for responses, continue light study or labbing to keep skills fresh (and
reduce anxiety). Now, final week ahead, we’ll refine any last interview issues and plan continuous
development.
Motivation:  Job hunting can be a job in itself – treat it like part of your study plan. You are selling a
product (your skills) that are genuinely valuable. Each “no” gets you closer to a “yes” statistically, and you
only  need  one  yes.  Remember  your  worth  with  CCNA  +  your  dedication  –  not  everyone  has  the
persistence to do what you did. Use that confidence when reaching out and interviewing. You are not
begging for a job; you are offering to help employers with your fresh skills and enthusiasm. That
positive, proactive mindset will shine through.
Week 19: Interview Refinement and Continuous Learning
Objectives (Week 19):
- By now you may start getting interview calls. This week, focus on any  specific feedback or upcoming
interviews . E.g., if you have an interview scheduled with a company that uses Cisco Meraki, read a bit
about Meraki dashboard so you can mention it. If one interview revealed a gap (say you got stumped by
a BGP question), do a quick study on BGP basics so you’re better prepared next time.
- Continue refining soft skills: practice speaking clearly about your experiences, maybe refine a story of
how you tackled a learning challenge (e.g., your six-month study journey itself is a great story to show
determination and how you handle a long-term project).
-  Network  further:  maybe  attend  a  local  networking  meetup  or  an  online  webinar  Cisco  hosts.
Sometimes you can mention these in interviews (“Recently I joined a Cisco webinar on SD-WAN, I’m
really interested in how that’s shaping networks” – shows interest beyond just what you had to study).
- Plan for  continued learning : Many interviewers ask “What are your future plans?“. State that you
intend to keep advancing – maybe plan CCNP Enterprise or DevNet Associate next, or that you’re
curious about cloud networking (if that’s true). This signals you’ll grow with the role.
- If job offer comes in (woohoo!), analyze it: consider role duties and growth opportunity, not just salary.
As an entry-level, you want a place where you can learn from senior engineers and get hands-on. If
multiple offers, weigh pros/cons (maybe consult your mentor).
- Even after landing a job, schedule time for continuous improvement. But for now, let’s focus on acing
any final interviews. 
Resources:
-  Advanced topics glimpses:  If applying to places with more advanced tech (like BGP, NAT64, wireless
controllers), you may not know deeply but a Cisco Live presentation or NetworkChuck video on that
topic can give you talking points.
- Community help:  The Cisco Learning Network forums have career sections – you can ask for advice or
read others’ stories of getting first job.
- Etiquette:  If you get offers or rejections, know how to professionally handle them (e.g., thank them for
consideration even if rejected – sometimes they keep you in mind for future if you’re gracious).
- Personal development:  Maybe pick up a book on professional soft skills or time management – this can
indirectly improve your workplace readiness. 
47

Milestones:
-  Milestone 1:  Evaluate how interviews are going. If you’ve done a few, what pattern of questions
emerges? Are there any you consistently struggle with? Focus on those now intensely. Perhaps mock
answer in front of a mirror until it’s smooth.
-  Milestone 2:  If you have an upcoming technical assessment or second-round interview, prepare
specifically: e.g., review that company’s tech stack (maybe gleaned from job description) and be ready to
discuss those topics. Also have some intelligent questions to ask them (like “I saw you use EIGRP – are
you planning any migration to OSPF or BGP? What’s the team’s approach to new technologies?” – shows
you care and think ahead).
- Milestone 3:  Keep applying if needed. Aim to fill your pipeline – interviews often come in waves. The
more you do, the more confident you become.
- Checkpoint:  By end of Month 6, ideally you have landed a job or are in late stages. If not, don’t despair
– sometimes it takes longer . Keep up applications and maybe seek feedback from each interview to
improve. Use the CCNA community for support. The key is not to stagnate: while searching, maybe start
on CCNP ENCOR study or labs to stay sharp and become even more qualified. That could be integrated
as next steps (though beyond this plan’s scope). 
Motivation:  You've transformed from a beginner to a certified professional with a plan. That’s huge! Now
the challenge is to get someone to give you that break – and they will, because your preparation shows.
Stay persistent and maintain the learning mindset. The end of this 6-month plan is really the beginning
of your career journey. The habits you built – regular study, lab practice, note-taking – will serve you well
on the job and for future certs. Be proud of how far you’ve come, and get excited for what’s ahead. You
got this!

3.0 IP Connectivity:  Interpret routing table components (route source codes, prefix, network
mask, next hop, AD, metric, gateway of last resort) ; Determine router forwarding
decisions (longest prefix match, then AD, then metric) ; Configure and verify IPv4 & IPv6
static routes (including default route, network route, host route, floating static) ; Single-
area OSPFv2 configuration & verification (neighbor adjacencies, network types like point-to-point
vs broadcast DR/BDR, Router ID) ; Purpose of first-hop redundancy protocols (HSRP, VRRP,
GLBP) – concepts of virtual gateway for redundancy .
