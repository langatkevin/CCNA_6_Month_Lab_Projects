This gives insight into why certain cabling (coax, twisted-pair , fiber) and\nwireless channels matter .\n(Academic) \u201cEnd-to-End Arguments in System Design\u201d  (Saltzer , Reed, Clark, 1984) \u2013 This seminal\npaper introduced the principle that reliability should be handled end-to-end (which underpins\nwhy TCP does error checking). Optional:  Read the first 2 pages to grasp the idea behind protocols\nlike TCP providing reliability rather than relying on network core.\nOnline Courses:\nCisco NetAcad \u2013 ITN v7 Module 3: Protocols and Models  \u2013 Goes through encapsulation\nprocess with examples; includes interactive activities. Complete Packet Tracer Activity \u201c3.5.5:\nInvestigate the TCP/IP and OSI Models in Action\u201d (this is a guided PT sim where you trace a web\nrequest through layers) .\nCoursera  \u201cComputer  Communications\u201d  Week  1  (Princeton  via  Coursera,  can  audit)  \u2013  This\noffers another explanation of layering and introduces Internet design principles. A different\nperspective can reinforce learning.\nHands-On Labs/Projects:\nLab 2.1: Inspecting Packets in Wireshark  \u2013 Install Wireshark  (free packet analyzer). Use Packet\nTracer\u2019s built-in Sniffer or your own PC\u2019s ping. In PT: connect a PC to a PT Cloud (internet) and\ngenerate traffic, capture it. Alternatively, on your actual computer , ping a site and capture in\nWireshark. Inspect an ICMP packet: identify the Ethernet frame header , IP header , and ICMP\ndata. Expected Outcome:  You can see the different protocol headers layered (Ethernet contains\nIP which contains ICMP). Take a screenshot labeling the layers.\nLab 2.2: Basic Switch Configuration  \u2013 In Packet Tracer , place a 2960 switch and a PC. On the\nswitch CLI, practice commands: set hostname ( hostname Week2Switch ), set a banner\nmessage ( banner motd \"Authorized Access Only\" ), configure an IP on the switch\u2019s\nVLAN1 interface (e.g. 192.168.1.10/24) so you could manage it, and set up a login password on\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n78\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n6\n\nthe console. Also practice the show interface status  and show running-config .\nExpected Outcome:  You become familiar with user EXEC vs config mode, and you have a switch\nwith basic settings. Save the PT file for reuse.\nLab 2.3: Media Demonstration  \u2013 If you have different cable types in Packet Tracer (copper\nstraight-through vs crossover vs fiber), set up a simple test: e.g. connect two switches with the\nwrong cable type and observe link down, then correct it. This will reinforce cable differences\n(Copper crossover for switch-switch if no auto-MDIX, fiber needs fiber ports, etc.).\nQuizzes/Assessments:\nWeek 2 Quiz (30 questions)  \u2013 Covering OSI vs TCP/IP layers, protocol examples, TCP vs UDP\ndifferences, and basic Cisco CLI commands. Sources: Try creating a custom quiz in a tool like\nQuizlet, or use exam prep books\u2019 chapter questions. Ensure you can answer: \u201cWhich OSI layer\ndoes XYZ occur?\u201d, \u201cWhat\u2019s the advantage of TCP over UDP and vice versa?\u201d, \u201cWhich cable for\nconnecting two switches?\u201d etc.\nNetAcad Module 3 Quiz  if using NetAcad.\nContinue adding to Anki: e.g. flashcards for \u201cTCP vs UDP \u2013 which is connection-oriented?\u201d,\n\u201cDefault port for HTTP?\u201d, \u201cCommand to set switch hostname?\u201d, etc. Aim for ~15 new flashcards\nthis week.\nTime Allocation (~13 hours):\n- Videos: ~3 hours (models, protocols, TCP/UDP)\n- Reading: ~3 hours (Cert Guide chapters, articles)\n- Labs/Practice: ~4 hours (Wireshark hands-on, switch CLI config, cable experiments)\n- Quizzes/Flashcards/Review: ~2\u20133 hours (includes Anki and discussing tricky quiz answers in forums or\nstudy group)\nMilestones & Checkpoints:\n- Milestone 1:  Write a short explanation (half-page) comparing TCP vs UDP  in your own words. Include\nan example application for each (e.g. \u201cTCP for HTTP web pages because\u2026, UDP for live video streaming\nbecause\u2026\u201d). This checks your understanding of reliability vs speed trade-offs.\n-  Milestone 2:  Complete the Wireshark lab and save a screenshot of a dissected packet. Label the\nEthernet, IP, and TCP/UDP headers in your screenshot as a mini-report.\n- Milestone 3:  Configure a Packet Tracer switch with a hostname and IP, and successfully ping it from\na connected PC  (means your config was correct). Save this PT file as \u201cWeek2_SwitchConfig.pt\u201d.\n- Achieve at least 25/30  on the Week 2 Quiz. For any missed questions, write down an explanation after\nresearching the answer \u2013 this will turn mistakes into learning.\n- Checkpoint:  You should now be comfortable with fundamental terminology and able to navigate the\nCLI basics. If terms like \u201cencapsulation\u201d, \u201csegment vs packet\u201d, or any layer functions are still confusing,\nrevisit the OSI chart or ask for clarification on forums (Cisco Learning Network community is helpful).\nMotivation:  Two weeks in, great work! At this point you\u2019ve laid the groundwork that many find abstract \u2013\nbut these concepts pay off later when we configure protocols. Keep remembering why you\u2019re doing\nthis: each protocol or model piece you master is a tool in your belt for real-world troubleshooting. If\nyou find yourself struggling, don\u2019t hesitate to revisit resources or try a different medium (video vs text).\nThe next couple of weeks we\u2019ll dive into IP addressing \u2013 arguably the heart of networking. Stay curious\nand keep up the momentum!\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n7"

This can be a quick refresher once you learn from Odom.\nComputer Networking (Kurose/Ross)  \u2013 Section 4.3 covers IP addressing and CIDR. It offers a\nconceptual view (skip heavy details on routing algorithms for now).\n(Reference) Subnetting Cheat Sheet  \u2013 find a reliable cheat sheet (like one on IPCisco or Cisco\u2019s\nsite)  that lists common subnet sizes (/24, /25, /26, \u2026 /30) with their block size, number of\nhosts, etc. Keep this for reference initially, but aim to memorize key subnet values over time.\nResearch Papers/Articles:\nRFC 1918 \u2013 Address Allocation for Private Internets  \u2013 skim this to see the official private IP\nranges (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16) and understand why/how they\u2019re reserved.\n\u201cSubnetting \u2013 Why and How\u201d  (Cisco Blog or PacketLife article) \u2013 an article explaining real-world\nuse of subnetting (segmentation, reduced broadcast domains).\nCisco Press Article: \u201cIPv6 Address Types\u201d  \u2013 outlines global vs link-local vs unique local, etc., in a\nstraightforward manner .

Do the lab exercises like \u201cSubnetting scenario\u201d if provided. NetAcad also\nhas a Subnetting Game  in some courses \u2013 use it to practice in a fun way.\nUdemy Free Subnetting Course  (if any exist, or simply find a free worksheet online) \u2013 Some\ninstructors have free sections or practice sets for subnetting. Timed subnetting quizzes help\nbuild speed (e.g., \u201csubnetting in your head\u201d challenges).\nHands-On Labs/Projects:\nLab 3.1: Subnetting Practice (Paper or Tool)  \u2013 Not a typical lab, but spend time manually\ncalculating  subnets. For example, take a Class C network 192.168.10.0/24 and practice making:\n(a) 2 subnets (each /25), (b) 4 subnets (/26), (c) 8 subnets (/27). Write down the subnet ID,\nbroadcast, and valid host range for each. Do similar for a /16. Use a whiteboard or spreadsheet if\nneeded. Check answers with a subnet calculator to verify.\nLab 3.2: Configure Subnets in Packet Tracer  \u2013 Build a small network with 3 subnets : e.g., one\nfor Branch1 PCs, one for Branch2 PCs, and one for the WAN link between two routers. For\ninstance: Router A (Branch1) with PC network 192.168.1.0/24, Router B (Branch2) with PC\nnetwork 192.168.2.0/24, and a /30 for the link between routers. Configure IPs on two routers\u2019\ninterfaces and on a PC in each subnet. Use static routes (we haven\u2019t formally covered yet, but you\ncan guess or look up how to add a static route) to ensure the two PCs can ping each other\nthrough the routers. Expected Outcome:  Both PCs, in different IP networks, communicate via\nthe routers (verifying your addressing and basic routing config). This is a preview of Week 4\u2019s\nrouting topics but reinforces addressing.\nLab 3.3: IPv6 Addressing Basics  \u2013 In Packet Tracer , enable IPv6 on a router and a PC: assign a\nglobal IPv6 address (e.g., 2001:DB8:1::1/64 on router , 2001:DB8:1::2/64 on PC) and a link-local\n(should auto-generate). Ping the link-local and global addresses to test connectivity. If unfamiliar\nwith IPv6 config, use a guide. Expected Outcome:  You can configure and verify IPv6 addressing\non Cisco IOS and understand the abbreviations. Document one example of an IPv6 address you\nused and identify its parts (network prefix, interface ID).\nQuizzes/Assessments:\nSubnetting Speed Quiz:  time yourself to find answers to 5 subnetting questions (e.g., \u201cHow\nmany hosts in a /27?\u201d, \u201cWhat is the subnet mask for 4 subnets of /24?\u201d). Resources like\nsubnettingpractice.com or random question generators help. Aim to get each within 1-2 minutes\nwithout referring to notes.\nBoson ExSim (if available) Subnetting section  \u2013 Boson practice exams have great subnetting\nquestions. If you have access, try a subset. If not, use free question dumps carefully on\nExamTopics \u2013 focus on understanding, not memorizing answers.\nChapter-end questions from Odom  \u2013 do all at end of IP addressing chapters.\nContinue adding flashcards: e.g., \u201cSubnet mask /26 = ? 255.255.255.192, hosts?\u201d, \u201cPrivate IP\nranges?\u201d, \u201cIPv6 link-local prefix?\u201d. Daily review previous cards \u2013 by now ~30+ cards in deck.\nTime Allocation (~14 hours):\n- Concept videos: ~2 hours (more time should be on practice than videos now)\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n9\n\n- Reading & Note-taking: ~3 hours (addressing chapters, articles)\n- Subnetting practice (paper/calculations): ~3 hours (spread out in sessions)\n- Packet Tracer labs: ~4 hours (multi-subnet network, IPv6 config)\n- Quizzes & flashcards: ~2 hours (including timed practice)\nMilestones & Checkpoints:\n- Milestone 1:  Be able to subnet a network in under 10 minutes  for a given scenario. For example,\n\u201cDesign an IP scheme for a company with 3 departments (50 hosts, 30 hosts, 20 hosts). What subnets\ndo you use out of 192.168.10.0/24?\u201d \u2013 Write out your solution and rationale.\n- Milestone 2:  Complete Lab 3.2 (2-router , 2-PC network) and demonstrate a successful ping from a PC\non Router A\u2019s network to a PC on Router B\u2019s network. This shows you can correctly assign IPs and even\nset a basic static route. Save this lab as \u201cWeek3_RoutingIntro.pt\u201d.\n-  Milestone 3:  List the three private IPv4 ranges from memory and explain in a few sentences  why\nprivate addresses need NAT to reach the Internet. Similarly, list at least two types of IPv6 addresses\n(e.g., \u201cLink-local starts with FE80, used only on local link\u201d).\n- Checkpoint:  By end of Week 3, subnetting should feel more comfortable.  If you still struggle, schedule\nextra practice \u2013 it\u2019s that important. Consider using a  subnetting app or game  daily for speed. Also\ncheck that you haven\u2019t neglected earlier topics: try explaining to yourself how OSI layers relate now that\nyou\u2019ve added IP (Layer3) knowledge.\nMotivation:  Subnetting is often a hurdle for beginners \u2013 if you\u2019ve cracked it this week, give yourself a pat\non the back! If not, don\u2019t panic; it  will click with continued practice. Many find it helpful to teach\nsomeone else (or an imaginary student) the process \u2013 this solidifies your mastery. You\u2019re now halfway\nthrough  the  fundamentals  phase.  Keep  up  the  disciplined  study  habits.  Next  week  we\u2019ll  wrap  up\nNetwork Fundamentals with more on IPv6, wireless, and some network services."

        "content": "Objectives (Week 4):\n- Solidify understanding of IPv6 : cover address types in more detail (global unicast, unique local, link-\nlocal, multicast, anycast) and IPv6 configuration on Cisco devices (SLAAC, DHCPv6 concepts).\n- Learn basic network troubleshooting tools : ping, traceroute , and OS commands to verify IP\nconfiguration ( ipconfig /ifconfig  on host OSes) . By CCNA blueprint, you should know how to\nverify IP parameters on Windows, Mac, Linux.\n- Explore wireless fundamentals : non-overlapping Wi-Fi channels (2.4GHz vs 5GHz), what an SSID is,\nbasics of Wi-Fi security (WPA2). This ties into Network Fundamentals (1.11 wireless principles) and\nSecurity Fundamentals (5.9 wireless security protocols) .\n- Introduction to network virtualization : concepts of VLAN (virtual LAN) vs VRF vs VPN (just definitions;\nwe will configure  VLANs in Month 2, but here understand that virtualization allows multiple networks on\nsame physical infrastructure). Also understand what a server virtualization  and container  means in\nnetworking contexts  (to meet 1.12 blueprint).\n- Conduct a  Month 1 review : revisit all main topics (devices, OSI, TCP/UDP, addressing). Identify any\nweak areas before moving to Month 2.\nResources:\n- Videos/Tutorials:\n- \u201cIPv6 Address Types\u201d  (KEITH Barker YouTube, ~20 min) \u2013 Keith (or similar instructor) explaining global\nvs local vs link-local addresses, multicast, and how IPv6 addresses auto-configure.\n- Jeremy\u2019s IT Lab Day 31-33 \u2013 IPv6 Parts 1-3  (YouTube, ~30 min each) \u2013 These cover IPv6 addressing\nand configuration in detail. Perhaps focus on Day 31 (IPv6 basics) and Day 32 (configuring IPv6) for now,\nand we can revisit Day 33 later for advanced IPv6 routing concepts.83\n84\n85\n10\n\n- \u201cWireless Networking Basics\u201d  (Cisco or CompTIA Network+ channel, ~15 min) \u2013 Introduction to Wi-Fi\nstandards (802.11), frequencies, channels, and security basics.\n- \u201cIntro to VLANs\u201d  (NetworkChuck, 10 min) \u2013 Though we\u2019ll do VLANs next month, watch this short video\nto  conceptualize  network  segmentation  (it  reinforces  the  idea  of  virtualization  at  Layer2,  part  of\nblueprint 1.12).\n-  (Optional) \u201cBasic  Troubleshooting  Tools\u201d  (CBT  Nuggets  or  Professor  Messer ,  10  min)  \u2013  A  quick\noverview of using ping, traceroute, etc., on different OSes.\nBooks/Chapters:\nCCNA Cert Guide (Vol. 1)  \u2013 Read Chapter 13: IPv6 Addressing & Subnetting . Focus on the sections\nabout IPv6 address types and the configuration examples (don\u2019t get bogged down in IPv6\nsubnetting \u2013 just know it conceptually, since CCNA may have a few IPv6 questions but not heavy\ncalculation).\nCert Guide Chapter 5: Network Protocols  (if not already covered) \u2013 Contains a section on ICMP\n(ping, traceroute) and basic DHCP/ARP concepts. This ties up some loose ends in fundamentals\n(knowing ARP as a link-layer address resolution, for example).\nCWNA (Certified Wireless Network Administrator) Study Guide  (if accessible) \u2013 skim the intro\nchapter on WLAN fundamentals to understand SSID, channels, and basic wireless security.\nAlternatively, any Cisco Press Wireless Fundamentals  chapter if available.\nVirtualization/Cloud  Basics:  A  short  chapter  or  whitepaper  on  virtualization  (e.g.,  \u201cIntro  to\nVirtualization\u201d by VMware or Cisco\u2019s Network Virtualization whitepaper) \u2013 focus on the idea of\nrunning multiple logical networks on one physical set of devices (this concept underlies VLANs,\nVRFs, and SDN).\nResearch Papers/Articles:\nCisco Blog: \u201cIPv6 \u2013 The Next Generation Internet\u201d  \u2013 an article by Cisco explaining why IPv6 is\nimportant, with some real-world adoption info.\n\u201cThe TCP/IP vs OSI Debate\u201d  \u2013 historical perspective article on why both models exist. (Good\nread to wrap up your understanding of models.)\nCisco Whitepaper: \u201cNetworking in Virtualized Environments\u201d  \u2013 describes challenges and\nsolutions when multiple VMs share a host (introduces virtual switches, etc.). Just read the\noverview to fulfill blueprint 1.12 context.\nOSI Model Quiz/Chart  \u2013 one more glance at a reference (StationX OSI cheat sheet  or similar)\nto ensure you can mentally map all layers after learning these services (e.g., know that ping uses\nICMP at Layer3, traceroute also uses Layer3, etc.).\nOnline Courses:\nCisco NetAcad \u2013 Module 10 (IPv6 Addressing) : Go through this module, which includes\nactivities on configuring IPv6 addresses and maybe an IPv6 Packet Tracer exercise.\nCisco NetAcad \u2013 Module 17 (Network Troubleshooting) : This might be in the later part of the\ncourse; if accessible, check out the portion on using ping and traceroute effectively.\nLabs from previous weeks : Consider redoing any NetAcad Packet Tracer labs now without\nlooking at instructions, as a self-test.\nHands-On Labs/Projects:\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 86\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n11\n\nLab 4.1: IPv6 Neighbor Discovery  \u2013 Extend Lab 3.3 (the IPv6 lab). Configure two routers\nconnected via IPv6. Enable OSPFv3 or simply static routes for IPv6 to see end-to-end connectivity.\nAlso, test the SLAAC  feature: on a router interface, enable it to advertise a prefix (turn on IPv6\nunicast-routing and use ipv6 address prefix/64 eui-64  on interface, or SLAAC configs).\nConfigure a PC to get an IPv6 address automatically. Expected Outcome:  The PC autoconfigures\na global IPv6 address (stateless) and can reach the router . Check the PC\u2019s IPv6 config to see link-\nlocal and autoconfigured addresses.\nLab 4.2: Wireless Router in Packet Tracer  \u2013 PT has generic wireless routers. Set up a PT home\nwireless router , give it an SSID \u201cWeek4WiFi\u201d with WPA2 password, and add a PC with a PT wireless\nNIC to connect to it. See if you can ping between wireless PC and a wired PC on that router .\nExpected Outcome:  Understand how a wireless client associates via SSID/security to an AP. (This\nlab is limited but gives a conceptual demo. Real gear would be needed for full effect, but PT can\nsimulate a bit.)\nLab 4.3: Basic Troubleshooting Scenarios  \u2013 Deliberately break things in a small PT network and\npractice troubleshooting: e.g., take a simple two-router network and misconfigure IP on one\nside, or use wrong default gateway on a PC, then use ping and traceroute  from the\ndevices to identify the issue. Document one scenario: describe the symptoms (e.g., PC1 can\u2019t\nreach PC2), your troubleshooting steps (ping X, got no reply, etc.), the identified problem, and\nthe fix.\n(Project) Fundamentals Summary Mind-Map:  As a wrap-up for Month 1, create a visual mind-\nmap or diagram that connects the concepts learned: Show how OSI layers relate to specific\nprotocols (HTTP at Layer7, TCP at Layer4, IP at Layer3, Ethernet at Layer2), list device types and\nwhere they operate, illustrate an IPv4 vs IPv6 address example, and indicate how subnetting\nbreaks a network. Making this map will reinforce the holistic view.\nQuizzes/Assessments:\nEnd-of-Month Fundamentals Exam:  Take a comprehensive practice test on all topics covered in\nMonth 1 (maybe 50 questions). You can use a mix of resources: some questions from ExamTopics\n(filter by fundamentals), some from Odom\u2019s end-of-part quizzes, or a free online CCNA\nfundamentals test. Treat it like a real exam: timed 60 minutes for 50 questions.\nBoson ExSim lite : If you have Boson, perhaps attempt a subset of one exam focusing on early-\ndomain questions.\nSkill drill : Perform a \u201cLayer-by-Layer\u201d drill \u2013 for a given scenario (like loading a webpage),\nverbally walk through each OSI layer and what happens. This isn\u2019t a formal quiz but a cognitive\nexercise to test integrated understanding. Possibly do this with a friend or mentor if available, or\nrecord yourself.\nTime Allocation (~12 hours):\n- Videos: ~2 hours (IPv6 and wireless intros)\n- Reading: ~2 hours (IPv6 chapter , wireless section, virtualization article)\n- Labs: ~5 hours (IPv6 configs, wireless PT, troubleshooting practice)\n- Review & Quizzes: ~3 hours (including the 50-question test and analysis of answers, plus assembling\nthe mind-map project)\nMilestones & Checkpoints:\n- Milestone 1:  Configure IPv6 on two routers and two PCs (as in Lab 4.1) so that all devices can ping\neach other\u2019s IPv6 global addresses. This confirms understanding of IPv6 addressing and basic routing.\nSave lab \u201cWeek4_IPv6.pt\u201d.\n- Milestone 2:  Write a short explanation of a real-world scenario using each wireless security protocol\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n12\n\n(e.g., \u201cWPA2 is currently common for home Wi-Fi, WPA3 is newer and more secure, WEP is obsolete\u201d).\nAlso list 3 non-overlapping channels in 2.4GHz (1, 6, 11) to demonstrate wireless basics knowledge.\n- Milestone 3:  Complete the Month 1 practice exam (50 Qs) with a score of ~80% or higher . Review each\nwrong answer and write down why the correct answer is correct. If score < 80%, identify weak areas and\nplan a revision in Week 5 (we can allocate some review time then).\n- Checkpoint: Fundamentals phase complete!  You should now be confident in network foundational\nconcepts. Verify that you have: a solid grasp of IP addressing and can do subnetting relatively quickly;\nfamiliarity with the CLI; understanding of how different network components function and interact. Any\nlingering confusion here should be addressed before moving on, as Months 2\u20134 will build on this\nfoundation. Don\u2019t hesitate to use community forums or study groups to clarify doubts.\nMotivation:  Month 1 down \u2013 awesome job. Many newcomers falter at the abstract concepts stage, but\nyou\u2019ve persevered. Now you have a base to build on. Take a moment to reflect on how much you\u2019ve\nlearned in just four weeks. Networking might still feel vast (it is), but piece by piece, you are conquering\nit. Stay curious and stay disciplined.  Next month, we\u2019ll start configuring networks in earnest (VLANs,\nrouting, etc.), which is where the fun really begins because you\u2019ll make things  work ! Enjoy a well-\ndeserved rest day before Month 2, and maybe reward yourself (you\u2019ve earned it!)."

There will be Packet Tracer labs for both (do them!).\nLabs from Packet Tracer Tutorials  \u2013 Cisco PT has some built-in sample labs (check \u201cOpen\nSample\u201d in PT). Look for any labeled VLAN or trunking to practice.\nUdemy (optional)  \u2013 If you find a cheap CCNA lab course, you can do a VLAN lab with them; but\nlikely your own practice is enough.\nHands-On Labs/Projects:\nLab 5.1: VLAN Configuration and Ping Test  \u2013 In Packet Tracer , set up one switch with 3 PCs on\nit. Create 2 VLANs (say VLAN10 and VLAN20). Put 2 PCs on VLAN10, and 1 PC on VLAN20. Assign\nIP addresses such that PCs in different VLANs are on different subnets (e.g., VLAN10 uses\n192.168.10.0/24, VLAN20 uses 192.168.20.0/24). Initially, do not configure any router . Verify that\u2022\n\u2022\n16\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n14\n\ntwo PCs in the same VLAN can ping each other (should work), but PCs in different VLANs cannot\n(expected, since no inter-VLAN routing yet). This shows VLAN segmentation.\nLab 5.2: Router-on-a-Stick  \u2013 Extend Lab 5.1 by adding a Router (2911 or similar in PT) and\nconnecting the switch to the router with one link. Configure that switch port as a trunk\n(switchport mode trunk ) and on the router configure subinterfaces: e.g. Gig0/0.10  for\nVLAN10, Gig0/0.20  for VLAN20, assign 192.168.10.1 and 192.168.20.1 respectively. Don\u2019t\nforget encapsulation dot1Q 10  etc. Now set each PC\u2019s default gateway to the router\u2019s\nsubinterface IP (PCs in VLAN10 use 192.168.10.1). Expected Outcome:  PCs in different VLANs\ncan now ping each other through the router . Also test pinging the router gateways. Save this lab\nas \u201cWeek5_VLAN_RouterOnStick.pt\u201d.\nLab 5.3: Trunking and Native VLAN  \u2013 Add a second switch to Lab 5.2, connected via a trunk link\nto the first switch. Put one PC on the second switch on VLAN10. Ensure trunk is up (use show\ninterfaces trunk ). The PC on switch2 VLAN10 should communicate with PCs on switch1\nVLAN10. Experiment by changing native VLAN on one side and see the effect (noticing errors or\nping issues if mismatched). Then set them correctly. Expected Outcome:  Understanding of how\ntrunks carry multiple VLANs and the importance of matching native VLANs.\n(Mini-Project) VLAN Design Document:  Imagine a small office network for a company with 3\ndepartments (e.g., Sales, Engineering, Guest WiFi). Sketch a simple network diagram showing 3\nVLANs, how they connect to a router or L3 switch for inter-VLAN routing, and propose an IP\nrange for each. Write a paragraph justifying the VLAN segmentation (e.g., \u201cto isolate guest traffic\nfrom internal\u201d, etc.). This is a design exercise to apply VLAN knowledge conceptually.\nQuizzes/Assessments:\nVLAN/Trunking Quiz:  ~15 questions focused on VLAN concepts. E.g., \u201cWhat command assigns a\nport to VLAN 10?\u201d, \u201cWhich VLAN ID range is normal vs extended?\u201d, \u201cWhat is the purpose of the\nnative VLAN?\u201d, \u201cTrue/False: Devices in different VLANs can communicate without a router .\u201d Use\nCCNA exam prep question banks or the NetAcad chapter quiz.\nInter-VLAN routing quiz:  ~10 questions on router-on-a-stick config (e.g., identify missing config\nin a scenario, or understand subinterface numbering).\nReview past topics:  include 5 mixed questions from Month 1 topics (to keep memory fresh).\nFlashcards: add key VLAN-related commands and concepts (e.g., \u201cDefault VLAN = ? (VLAN1)\u201d,\n\u201c802.1Q tag adds how many bytes? (4 bytes)\u201d, \u201cRouter-on-a-stick requires what encapsulation\ncommand?\u201d, etc.).\nTime Allocation (~13 hours):\n- Videos: ~2 hours (VLAN + inter-VLAN demos)\n- Reading: ~2 hours (Cert Guide + articles)\n- Labs/Practical: ~6 hours (it will take time to configure, test, troubleshoot VLAN labs, especially trunking\nwith multiple switches)\n- Quizzes & flashcards: ~2 hours\n- Note consolidation: ~1 hour (documenting lab results, updating your notes with configurations done\nand lessons learned)\nMilestones & Checkpoints:\n- Milestone 1:  Successfully implement a router-on-a-stick with at least 2 VLANs and verify connectivity\nbetween  VLANs via the router . Confirm by screenshotting ping tests from a PC in VLAN10 to a PC in\nVLAN20, along with a show ip interface brief  on the router showing subinterfaces up.\n- Milestone 2:  Describe in your notes the difference between an Access Port  and a Trunk Port . List the\ncommands to configure each. Also note the typical native VLAN (default 1) and how to change it.\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n15\n\n- Milestone 3:  Score 80%+ on the VLAN/Inter-VLAN quizzes. If any VLAN concept is wrong (for example,\nconfusion about extended VLAN range or how trunk tagging works), revisit that portion in Odom or\nvideos until clear .\n- Checkpoint:  You\u2019ve now done substantial switch configuration. Ensure you can confidently navigate\nshow vlan , show interfaces trunk , and understand what it means. If possible, discuss with a\npeer or in a forum one of your labs (explaining what you did helps cement knowledge). Heading into\nWeek 6, we\u2019ll tackle Spanning Tree and EtherChannel, which build on the VLAN/trunk knowledge. Make\nsure trunking is solid in your mind (we\u2019ll see why STP is needed when redundancy is introduced).\nMotivation:  Setting up VLANs is your first real network engineering  task \u2013 you segmented a network and\nmade them talk. This is exactly what network engineers do in enterprises. Reflect on how far you\u2019ve\ncome from \u201cwhat is a network\u201d to actually configuring multi-VLAN networks! The first time is always the\nhardest; it gets easier . If things didn\u2019t work initially, that\u2019s normal \u2013 troubleshooting and figuring out why\n(maybe a missing encapsulation  command or mis-assigned port) is where real learning happens.\nEmbrace those moments. Keep this momentum into Week 6."

Only read the intro and\nmaybe the part about how port roles differ (alternate/discarding vs blocking).\nNetworking Forum discussions  \u2013 find a Q&A on something like \u201cWhy did my EtherChannel not\nform?\u201d or \u201cSTP blocking port on redundant link \u2013 is it working correctly?\u201d to see real-world\napplication of these concepts.\nEtherChannel vs STP design  \u2013 a blog that explains how EtherChannel can be used to prevent\nSTP from needing to block ports (because from STP\u2019s perspective, an EtherChannel is one logical\nlink). This is more design-oriented but enriches understanding.\nOnline Courses:\nCisco NetAcad \u2013 SRWE v7 Module 4: STP  and Module 5: EtherChannel. Go through these\nchapters, do the Packet Tracer activities such as \u201c4.6.6 Packet Tracer \u2013 Investigate STP\u201d (if\navailable) where you can see STP in action, and \u201c5.x.x Packet Tracer \u2013 Configure EtherChannel\u201d.\nThese labs align perfectly with our objectives.\nLab challenges : Some online resources have \u201cchallenge labs\u201d for CCNA (like showing a network\ndiagram and asking you to configure STP priorities, etc.). If you find one, try it out.\nPractice exam on L2 : If your study resources have topic-wise exams, take one on \u201cNetwork\nAccess\u201d at the end of this week to gauge your progress on switching topics.\nHands-On Labs/Projects:\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n89\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n17\n\nLab 6.1: Spanning Tree Exploration  \u2013 Use your Lab 5.3 topology (two switches connected by\ntwo links? If not, create a scenario with 2 switches and 2 redundant links between them, plus a\ncouple PCs). By default STP will block one link. Use show spanning-tree  on each switch to\nidentify the root bridge, root ports, and blocked port. Task:  Change the bridge priority on one\nswitch to make it the root for VLAN1 deliberately (e.g., spanning-tree vlan 1 priority\n4096). Observe how STP reconverges and which ports are now forwarding/blocking. Also test\nPortFast: set one of the PC access ports as PortFast ( spanning-tree portfast  on Cisco). The\nPC\u2019s port should go into forwarding immediately on link up (in PT this might be hard to notice,\nbut conceptually note it). Expected Outcome:  You can interpret STP status and influence root\nelection. Document which switch became root and which port got blocked and why.\nLab 6.2: Configure EtherChannel (LACP)  \u2013 Take two switches with 4 connections between them\n(or add additional links to an existing topology). Before EtherChannel, STP would block all but\none. Now configure EtherChannel: e.g. on both switches do interface range f0/1-2 ,\nchannel-group 1 mode active  (LACP active). Do same for f0/1-2 on the other switch (active\nor passive mode). This should form an EtherChannel bundling two ports. Verify with show\netherchannel summary . Ensure you assign the EtherChannel (Port-channel1) as trunk or\naccess appropriately. Expected Outcome:  The EtherChannel comes up (flags \u201cSU\u201d in summary)\nand STP now sees it as a single link, preventing loops while both physical links carry traffic. Test\nby sending pings while bringing down one member link to see traffic continues.\nLab 6.3: Integrated Network Challenge  \u2013 Design a scenario that uses everything from"

NetAcad has a lab \u201cConfigure Static Routing\u201d \u2013 do it. Also, they might have a Packet\nTracer for HSRP. If yes, try it.\nLab Practice  \u2013 Some websites (like Free CCNA Workbook) have static routing labs. Use those\ndescriptions to set up scenarios.\nPacket Tracer Challenge  \u2013 Use PT\u2019s Activity Wizard or find some PT activities shared online for\nstatic routing challenges (like a troubleshooting scenario where you must add missing routes).\nHands-On Labs/Projects:\nLab 7.1: Static Routing Basic  \u2013 Create a topology of 3 routers in a chain (R1\u2014R2\u2014R3) with three\nnetworks: network A between R1 and R2, network B between R2 and R3, and a loopback or LAN\noff R1 and R3 each to simulate end networks. Without dynamic routing, configure static routes\nso that: R1 knows how to reach R3\u2019s LAN, R3 knows how to reach R1\u2019s LAN, and both use R2 as\nnext hop. Also R2 needs routes to both LANs (or use default routes strategically). Expected\nOutcome:  End devices on R1\u2019s LAN can ping end devices on R3\u2019s LAN. Test by pinging across and\npossibly traceroute to see the path. Document the routing table of each router ( show ip\nroute output) to confirm the routes.\nLab 7.2: Static Route Failover (Floating Static)  \u2013 Modify Lab 7.1 by adding a redundant link:\ne.g., a direct link between R1 and R3 (so we have two paths between R1 and R3: one via R2, one\ndirect). On R1, set a primary static route to R3\u2019s LAN via R2. Then set a floating static  (higher AD)\nvia the direct link. Do the inverse on R3. Test: when everything up, traffic goes via R2 (check\ntraceroute). Shut down the R1-R2 interface to simulate failure; traffic should reroute via direct\nR1-R3 link thanks to the floating static. Expected Outcome:  You see failover in action with static\nroutes (this parallels what dynamic routing or FHRP would do automatically). This solidifies\nunderstanding of AD (administrative distance) and backup routes.\nLab 7.3: HSRP Configuration  (optional if time and interest) \u2013 If Packet Tracer supports HSRP on\nrouters (it does on multilayer switches for sure, routers maybe), set up two routers both\nconnected to a LAN (e.g., PC, Switch, and two routers all in VLAN 10). Configure HSRP on the\nrouters for that VLAN10 network: give them a virtual IP as default gateway for the PC. Make one\nrouter active with higher priority. Observe that the PC\u2019s default gateway is the virtual IP, but it\u2019s\nbeing served by Router1. Then shut Router1\u2019s interface and see Router2 take over (PC should still\nping out, perhaps to a simulated internet cloud or another network). Expected Outcome:  The\nPC doesn\u2019t lose connectivity when the primary gateway router goes down \u2013 HSRP provides\nredundancy. Use show standby  on routers to see HSRP status. \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n21\n\nLab 7.4: Troubleshoot Static Routes  \u2013 Intentionally break something in a static route setup:\ne.g., omit a route on one of the routers and see how ping fails one direction. Practice diagnosing:\nuse ping, then traceroute , then check routing tables, then fix route. Document this\nprocess as if writing a troubleshooting ticket resolution.\n(Design Exercise) Default Gateway Redundancy Plan:  Write a small memo for a hypothetical\nnetwork: two edge routers serving a network. Propose which FHRP to use (say VRRP if multi-\nvendor or HSRP if Cisco-only) and why. Outline the config steps at high level. This isn\u2019t execution\nbut demonstrates you understand the problem FHRPs solve and how you\u2019d apply it.\nQuizzes/Assessments:\nStatic Routing Quiz:  ~10 questions: covering syntax ( ip route  command format), how to\ninterpret a routing table entry, the effect of AD, and maybe a simple scenario question (\u201cPC can\u2019t\nreach server , which static route is missing?\u201d).\nFHRP Quiz:  ~5 questions: mostly conceptual \u2013 \u201cWhat does HSRP provide?\u201d, \u201cWhich FHRP is Cisco-\nproprietary vs open?\u201d, \u201cHow does a host use HSRP \u2013 what IP does it have as gateway?\u201d, etc.\nSubnetting/IP review:  Include a few questions to keep subnetting fresh (never stop practicing!).\ne.g., \u201cWhich of these is a valid /30 network address?\u201d or \u201cYou need at least 100 hosts, which mask\ndo you choose?\u201d\nNetAcad Chapter quiz  for static routing (if using NetAcad).\nContinue Anki: static vs dynamic routing definitions, HSRP default port (maybe not needed, but\ncould note HSRP uses virtual MAC starting with 0000.0C07.ACxx \u2013 trivia that might appear),\ncommand for floating static route (just adding AD at end), etc.\nTime Allocation (~12 hours):\n- Videos: ~2 hours (routing fundamentals, FHRP)\n- Reading: ~2 hours (Cert guide static route chapter , FHRP sections)\n- Labs: ~6 hours (static route labs, including failover scenario and possibly HSRP)\n- Quizzes/Flashcards: ~2 hours (analysis of mistakes, reviewing tricky parts like VLSM or static route\nrecursion if any)\nMilestones & Checkpoints:\n-  Milestone  1:  Configure  static  routes  on  a  multi-router  topology  and  demonstrate  end-to-end\nconnectivity. Provide a screenshot of  show ip route  from each router with explanations of each\nroute entry (e.g., \u201cS 10.1.1.0/24 [1/0] via 10.2.0.2\u201d means a static route to network 10.1.1.0 with AD 1 via\nnext-hop 10.2.0.2). Explaining the routing table cements your understanding.\n- Milestone 2:  Achieve a successful static route failover test (if attempted): demonstrate via traceroute\nor ping that traffic reroutes when primary path is down. This shows grasp of AD and backup routes.\n- Milestone 3:  Be able to describe how HSRP/VRRP works without notes. For example: \u201cHSRP: two or\nmore routers form a group with a virtual IP; one is active (forwarding) with virtual MAC, another is\nstandby; if active fails, standby takes over virtual IP/MAC so hosts don\u2019t notice.\u201d If you can say that,\nyou\u2019re set for CCNA-level FHRP knowledge.\n- Milestone 4:  Static routing quiz score ~100% (it\u2019s a small topic, aim to perfect it), FHRP quiz ~80%. If\nany confusion remains (like difference between GLBP vs HSRP), clarify now.\n- Checkpoint:  You\u2019ve laid the groundwork for dynamic routing. Static routes are fine but imagine doing\nthat for 50 routers \u2013 not scalable. You should be eagerly anticipating how a protocol like OSPF will\nautomate route distribution \u2013 that\u2019s next week. Also ensure you haven\u2019t lost touch with switching:\nmaybe in labs you combined VLANs with routing (router on stick is static route case). If not, maybe\nquickly review your inter-VLAN lab to see static routes in action (the router had connected routes for\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n22\n\nVLANs; static routes might have been used on switches if L3 switch, etc.). Everything\u2019s building up. On to\nOSPF!"

Practice a basic OSPF setup on a multi-router\ntopology and verify adjacency formation ( show ip ospf neighbor ) and routes ( show ip route\nshowing OSPF routes).\n- Handle OSPF attributes: set the Router ID manually (and know auto-selection rules), observe that OSPF\nchooses a DR/BDR on broadcast networks (maybe simulate with 3 routers in one LAN).\n- Basic OSPF troubleshooting: e.g., mismatched subnet masks or areas causing no adjacency.\n- Cover OSPF for IPv6 (OSPFv3) conceptually \u2013 CCNA may not heavily test it, but know that OSPFv3 exists\nand is similar but separate process for IPv6. If time, configure one OSPFv3 instance for practice.\n- Emphasize that OSPF is a key CCNA topic \u2013 possibly multiple exam questions, so spend ample time to\nmaster fundamentals.\nResources:\n- Videos/Tutorials:\n- Jeremy\u2019s IT Lab Day 14 & 15 \u2013 OSPF (Parts 1 & 2)  (YouTube, ~30 min each) \u2013 These cover OSPF basics,\nconfiguration, neighbor relationships, etc., in CCNA-focused detail .

If curious, watch a short explanation.\nBooks/Chapters:\nCCNA Cert Guide (Vol. 2)  \u2013 Read the OSPF chapter very thoroughly. It likely covers single-area\nconfig, OSPF operation concepts, neighbor relationships, and troubleshooting tips. Make sure\nyou understand how OSPF identifies neighbors (by matching area, authentication (if any),\nsubnet, hello/dead timers, etc.). For CCNA, main things: matching subnet mask and area must\nmatch for adjacency; router ID selection (highest loopback IP or highest active IP if no manual\nID); the concept of DR/BDR on multiaccess networks \u2013 only one DR/BDR per network segment to\nreduce adjacencies.\nAny included labs or examples in the text \u2013 do them or simulate them in Packet Tracer as you\nread.\n\u201cOSPF LSA Types Simplified\u201d  (if in text or an appendix) \u2013 not required to memorize types, but\nreading a summary might help you understand how OSPF shares info (Link State29\n28\n9495\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n23\n\nAdvertisements). CCNA might have a question like \u201cWhich routing protocol floods link-state\nadvertisements?\u201d or \u201cWhich routing protocol uses cost as metric?\u201d which you should easily\nanswer by now.\nIf you have a lab manual or guide , see if there\u2019s an OSPF exercise; doing more than one OSPF lab\nis useful.\nResearch Papers/Articles:\nRFC 2328  \u2013 OSPFv2 Specification (again not to read fully, but maybe the intro and rationale). The\nfirst paragraph often states it\u2019s a link-state routing protocol using SPF algorithm.\n\u201cOSPF Neighbor Troubleshooting Checklist\u201d  (Cisco Support) \u2013 gives common reasons two\nOSPF routers won\u2019t form adjacency (e.g., area mismatch, IP mismatch, passive interface, etc.).\nKeep this as a reference to troubleshoot your labs if needed.\nPacketLife OSPF Cheat Sheet  \u2013 a one-page summary of OSPF, might list LSA types, state\nmachine, etc. Good for quick review or to see the big picture.\nCisco Design Guide excerpt  \u2013 maybe a section about when to use single-area vs multi-area\nOSPF (CCNA doesn\u2019t require multi-area config, but understanding that large networks can be\nsegmented into areas is good).\n(Industry) \u201cWhy  OSPF  is  widely  used\u201d  \u2013  a  blog  or  article  extolling  OSPF\u2019s  scalability,  fast\nconvergence, etc., compared to, say, RIP (which is outdated). Just to reinforce you\u2019re learning a\nrelevant protocol.\nOnline Courses:\nCisco NetAcad \u2013 Enterprise Networking, Security & Automation (ENSA) v7  likely has OSPF in\ndepth. If available, do Module on OSPF (single-area). They will have Packet Tracer labs like\n\u201cConfigure Single-Area OSPFv2\u201d and maybe an OSPF troubleshooting PT. Do these.\nBoson NetSim (optional)  if you have it or similar simulation with guided labs, try an OSPF lab\nscenario.\nGNS3 labs (optional)  \u2013 If you want more realism, you could try a GNS3 or CML lab for OSPF, but\nPacket Tracer suffices for CCNA-level OSPF.\nHands-On Labs/Projects:\nLab 8.1: OSPF Basic Configuration  \u2013 Use a 3 or 4-router topology (could reuse static routing lab\nbut remove static routes). Configure OSPF on all routers in Area 0. You can use the network\ncommands (e.g., network 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.255 area 0  to cover certain ranges, or identify\neach interface). Ensure all routers become neighbors (use show ip ospf neighbor ). Assign a\nLoopback interface on one router to observe how OSPF advertises it (it should appear as O IA or\nO route in others if not area 0? Actually in single area it\u2019s just O). Expected Outcome:  All routers\nhave routes to all networks via OSPF in their routing tables. Test connectivity across the network.\nLab 8.2: OSPF Router ID and Neighbor Relationships  \u2013 In the above lab, set router IDs\nmanually ( router-id X.X.X.X ) that are easy to identify (e.g., 1.1.1.1 for R1, etc.). Reload\nOSPF (clear process) so they take effect. Observe neighbor outputs listing these IDs. Then\nsimulate a multiaccess segment: e.g., connect 3 routers to a single switch (or multi-point cloud)\nto simulate them on the same Ethernet. See in show ip ospf neighbor  which one is DR,\nBDR, DROTHER \u2013 by default highest router ID becomes DR. Try changing OSPF priority on one\nrouter to make it DR. Expected Outcome:  Understanding of DR/BDR election \u2013 only DR and BDR\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n24\n\nshow full adjacency with all, others (DROTHER) have 2-way with each other but full only with DR/\nBDR. For CCNA, just know conceptually, but seeing it is nice.\nLab 8.3: OSPF Passive Interface and Default Route  \u2013 Take one of your routers (like an edge\nrouter) and configure a default route (maybe to a fake internet cloud or a stub network) and\ninject it into OSPF (using default-information originate ). Make some interface passive\n(like LAN interfaces that shouldn\u2019t form OSPF neighbor). Ensure OSPF still advertises the\nconnected networks but doesn\u2019t try to neighbor on passive interfaces. Expected Outcome:  Your\ninternal routers receive a default route from OSPF (marked as O*E2 usually), and you\nunderstand passive-interface usage (security and efficiency to not send hellos on e.g. user LANs).\nLab 8.4: OSPFv3 for IPv6 (optional)  \u2013 If eager , configure OSPF for IPv6 on a dual-stack network.\nEven if just between two routers. This uses ipv6 ospf  commands on interfaces and router\nospf <id> ipv6 . Verify with show ipv6 ospf . Not heavily needed for CCNA, but one lab\nhelps reinforce OSPF knowledge and demystifies IPv6 routing.\n(Project) OSPF Study Notes  \u2013 Create a one-page \u201cOSPF cheatsheet\u201d in your own words: including\nOSPF  message  types  (Hello,  LSU,  LSA  concepts),  neighbor  requirements,  OSPF  metrics  and\ndefault reference bandwidth, and common show commands and their meaning. This act of\nsummarizing will prepare you for any exam question on OSPF as you\u2019ll have organized the info\nyourself.\nQuizzes/Assessments:\nOSPF Concepts Quiz:  ~15-20 questions. Cover OSPF basics: e.g., \u201cWhat algorithm does OSPF\nuse?\u201d (SPF/Dijkstra), \u201cHow does OSPF elect DR?\u201d (highest router ID or priority), \u201cWhich multicast\naddresses does OSPF use for updates?\u201d (224.0.0.5, maybe too deep for CCNA, but possibly trivial\nQ), \u201cWhat\u2019s the default OSPF cost of a 100Mb link?\u201d (1, since reference BW 100 Mb), etc. Mix\nconcept and config questions.\nOSPF Configuration Quiz:  ~5 questions focusing on interpretation: e.g., given partial show\nrunning-config , does OSPF appear correctly configured? Or \u201cWhich command verifies OSPF\nadjacencies?\u201d (show ip ospf neighbor vs show ip route ospf).\nTroubleshoot scenario Q:  maybe a question: \u201cRouter A OSPF config has area 0, Router B has\narea 1 on their connected link \u2013 will they form adjacency?\u201d (Answer: No, area mismatch). Include\none or two like that.\nReview of older topics:  a few questions from switching or static routing just to keep them fresh.\nPerhaps \u201cWhat does a switch do if it doesn\u2019t know destination MAC?\u201d or \u201cWhich command on a\nswitch enables you to see if a port is in err-disabled state?\u201d (to recall STP maybe).\nFlashcards: Expand OSPF deck \u2013 e.g., \u201cDefault OSPF Hello interval on Ethernet? (10s) Dead\ninterval? (40s)\u201d, \u201cOSPF AD? (110) vs EIGRP AD (90) vs static (1) \u2013 a bit of comparative knowledge\nhelps.\u201d, \u201cNeighbors not forming \u2013 check area, masks, timers, auth, MTU\u201d. Reviewing these\nregularly will make OSPF second nature.\nTime Allocation (~14 hours):\n- Videos: ~3 hours (OSPF requires some time to digest)\n- Reading: ~3 hours (this is a heavy chapter likely; do it in segments)\n- Labs: ~6 hours (multiple OSPF labs as described; OSPF often requires tweaking and wait times for\nconvergence, so be patient)\n-  Quizzes/Review:  ~2  hours  (going  through  multi-choice  and  verifying  against  labs/reading  for\ncorrectness)\nMilestones & Checkpoints:\n- Milestone 1:  Configure a multi-router OSPF network and achieve full connectivity without any static\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n25\n\nroutes. Provide evidence: e.g., ping from one end to the other  and the routing table from a router\nshowing OSPF-learned routes. If you trust OSPF\u2019s routes and they match expectations (correct subnets\nand next hops), you did it right.\n- Milestone 2:  Demonstrate understanding of OSPF neighbor relationships. For instance, intentionally\nmisconfigure a parameter (like area) to see adjacency fail, then correct it. Or identify in a multiaccess\nnetwork which router became DR and why. Jot down a brief explanation of OSPF neighbor states and\nroles in your notes (even if CCNA doesn\u2019t test state names deeply, the process of explaining helps).\n- Milestone 3:  Score at least ~75-80% on OSPF quizzes. OSPF has nuance, so if you miss some, focus on\nthose  topics  again.  Key  point:  You  should  be  comfortable  with  reading  an  OSPF  config  and\nunderstanding what each part does (network statements, router-id, etc.), and interpreting show ip\nospf neighbor/route  outputs. If any output line confuses you, clarify it now (like OSPF route codes:\nO = intra-area, O IA = interarea, E1/E2 = external \u2013 CCNA mostly single area so probably O routes only).\n- Checkpoint:  With OSPF covered, you have tackled the most complex part of CCNA routing. Ensure you\nalso recall earlier routing topics: difference between OSPF and RIP/EIGRP (just basics: OSPF link-state vs\nRIP distance-vector), but note EIGRP is not in CCNA anymore aside from a mention. Double-check IP\nConnectivity blueprint: we\u2019ve done static, OSPF, FHRP. The blueprint also lists understanding  routing\ntable components  and forwarding decision process , which we\u2019ve done. Also, first-hop redundancy (done\nconceptually). At this stage, you can route within and between networks pretty proficiently! Month 3 is\nnot over \u2013 we\u2019ll now apply this in context of IP services."

        "content": "Objectives (Week 9):\n- Understand and configure DHCP  (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) on Cisco devices : both\nDHCP server (on a router or multilayer switch) and DHCP relay (IP Helper). Know the DHCP process\n(DORA: Discover , Offer , Request, Ack) and what information is provided (IP, subnet mask, gateway, DNS,\netc.).\n- Set up  NAT (Network Address Translation)  on a router for IPv4: specifically  PAT (Port Address\nTranslation)  for allowing multiple internal hosts to share one public IP (this is the typical use case). Also\nknow static NAT (one-to-one) usage and configuration. CCNA expects you to configure and verify NAT in\nIOS.\n- Learn about  NTP (Network Time Protocol)  and configure a router or switch to use NTP client\nmode (sync with a server) and potentially act as NTP server for others. Understand the importance of\ntime sync in networks (for logging, certificates, etc.).\n- Cover SNMP and Syslog  concepts  \u2013 possibly configuration basics: setting up a SNMP community\non a router , and logging to a syslog server . We might not do deep labs on these, but at least know how\nto verify and the purpose (monitoring, network operations).\n-  Introduce  QoS  basics  (Quality  of  Service):  know  what  QoS  is  for  \u2013  to  prioritize  certain  traffic.\nSpecifically, CCNA might mention classification and marking (DSCP values) and queueing strategies \u2013\njust theoretical understanding. Possibly see how a router shows QoS config, but configuration likely not\nrequired.\n- Summarize IP Services domain topics and ensure each is touched: DNS  (role in network \u2013 not config on\nrouter , but know it translates names and often there\u2019s a \u201cip name-server\u201d command to allow router to\nresolve  names),  FTP/TFTP  uses  (for  file  transfer  e.g.,  router  IOS  upgrade  via  TFTP) ,  and  SSH\nconfiguration on Cisco devices (we did some in earlier labs implicitly, but ensure you can configure a\nrouter/switch for SSH access).\nResources:\n- Videos/Tutorials:\n- \u201cDHCP Configuration on Cisco\u201d  by Keith or Jeremy (YouTube, ~10 min) \u2013 demonstrates setting up a\nDHCP pool on a router and using a relay.9697\n98\n99\n100\n101\n26\n\n- Jeremy\u2019s IT Lab Day 19 \u2013 DHCP  (YouTube, ~20 min) \u2013 likely covers DHCP concepts and a Packet Tracer\ndemo.\n- \u201cNAT Explained + Config\u201d  by NetworkChuck (YouTube, 15 min) \u2013 Chuck shows inside/local vs outside/\nglobal, typically with coffee shop analogy, then does a PAT config. Good for beginners to catch the idea.\n- Jeremy\u2019s IT Lab Day 20 \u2013 NAT  (YouTube, ~30 min) \u2013 thorough NAT config demos including static, PAT,\nverification ( show ip nat translations  etc.).\n- \u201cNTP and Syslog\u201d  (CBT Nuggets or Pluralsight snippet, ~10 min) \u2013 explaining how to set timezone, NTP\nserver , and how syslog logging levels work. If not accessible, try a YouTube video on \u201cConfiguring NTP\non Cisco\u201d (plenty of free ones, ~5 min).\n- (Optional) \u201cSNMP Basics\u201d  by Professor Messer (Network+ video, ~5 min) \u2013 covers SNMP v2 vs v3 basics\nand how SNMP is used. Enough for concept.\nBooks/Chapters:\nCCNA Cert Guide (Vol. 2)  \u2013 It will have chapters on IP Services. Read sections on: DHCP (how to\nconfigure a DHCP server on IOS, and DHCP relay agent using ip helper-address ), NAT\n(inside/outside concepts, static vs pool vs PAT configuration, and common show commands),\nNTP (simple client config), DNS (just that a router can be a DNS client or we can use \u201cip host\u201d to\nmap names, etc.), SNMP (just overview of community strings and basic SNMP operations GET/\nSET), Syslog (levels 0-7 and how to set logging). QoS likely has a short section \u2013 focus on\nunderstanding classification, marking (like DSCP), and trust boundaries in a campus (maybe\nbeyond CCNA but just in case).\nLab Manual / 31 Days  \u2013 likely has a day for NAT and one for DHCP. Go through those for more\npractice questions.\nCisco Press articles  \u2013 often there are short guides like \u201cNAT Fundamentals\u201d on Cisco website.\nUse if you need alternate explanation, especially the NAT address terminology.\nResearch Papers/Articles:\nRFC 2131  \u2013 DHCP protocol (just read a bit of intro if curious; know it\u2019s UDP 67/68 for exam\npossibly).\nCisco Docs: \u201cConfiguring Network Address Translation\u201d  \u2013 covers IOS commands and\nexamples for static NAT, PAT, etc.\n\u201cTroubleshooting NAT\u201d  article \u2013 common NAT issues (like not clearing NAT translations after\nconfig changes, or forgetting ACL for NAT if needed). Might not be needed if labs go smooth, but\ngood reading.\nNTP.org brief  \u2013 maybe a page explaining NTP strata, but CCNA probably won\u2019t ask that. However ,\nnote NTP uses UDP 123, maybe an exam trivial.\nSNMP vs Syslog  \u2013 an article explaining how they differ for network monitoring.\nQoS Basics  \u2013 Cisco has a doc \u201cIP QoS Intro\u201d or search for \u201cDiffServ QoS tutorial\u201d to get the idea of\nwhat classification and PHB mean  (this correlates to blueprint mentioning PHB for QoS).\nOnline Courses:\nCisco NetAcad \u2013 ENSA Modules  likely cover NAT (there\u2019s a known PT lab \u201cConfigure PAT\u201d) and\nDHCP (\u201cDHCP server PT activity\u201d). Do those labs from NetAcad if you have them. They also cover\nNTP and maybe QoS basics.\nSkillsoft/Pluralsight  \u2013 if you have access, maybe one of their CCNA courses has a quick lab on\nDHCP and NAT. Not required, but extra perspective if needed. \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n102 103\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n27\n\nTry HackMe / Packet Tracer mini-games  \u2013 not sure if any gamified content for these, but\nrunning through config is straightforward enough.\nHands-On Labs/Projects:\nLab 9.1: DHCP Server and Relay  \u2013 Take a router (or switch) as central and two networks: e.g.,\nRouter with two LAN interfaces: one LAN has a router directly connected to PCs, another LAN\nmaybe behind a switch. Configure one router as DHCP server  for both networks (two pools). For\nthe network where router isn\u2019t directly connected (say a router connected to another router\nwhich connects to PCs), use DHCP Relay: on that intermediate router interface, configure ip\nhelper-address <DHCP-server-IP> . Test from PCs: they should get IPs in correct ranges\nalong with gateway (the router) and DNS if configured. Expected Outcome:  PC on each network\nreceives valid IP config via DHCP. Use show ip dhcp binding  on server to verify leases.\nLab 9.2: NAT/PAT Configuration  \u2013 Create a scenario: Router with an \u201cinside\u201d network (e.g.,\n192.168.10.0/24 with a couple PCs) and an \u201coutside\u201d network (simulate the internet or a stub\nnetwork with a server , using, say, 203.0.113.0/24). Configure PAT on the router so that all inside\naddresses can share the router\u2019s outside IP. On PCs, set their gateway to the router inside IP. Test\nby pinging the \u201cinternet\u201d server from a PC. It should work if NAT is correctly translating. Do\nshow ip nat translations  to see the dynamic entries (you\u2019ll see inside local, inside global,\netc.). Also test something like port translation by maybe using a simulated service if possible, but\nping should suffice. Optionally, configure a static NAT  for one inside host (like make one PC\nreachable from outside on a static mapping). Try accessing it from the \u201coutside\u201d side. Expected\nOutcome:  Internal PCs reach outside resources with NAT functioning, and any static NAT\nmapping works for inbound.\nLab 9.3: NTP and Syslog  \u2013 If you have an accessible NTP server (maybe Packet Tracer can\nsimulate one, or use router as NTP master), configure routers to sync time. E.g., one router as\nNTP master (or actual public NTP if PT supports sending to an address but likely not), others as\nclients. Use show clock  to verify time sync. For Syslog, perhaps set up one router as a syslog\nreceiver by using a loopback as the \u201csyslog server\u201d (PT might not simulate an actual syslog server\napplication, but you can at least set logging <ip>  on devices). At minimum, configure\nlogging host on a router and generate some log (like interface up/down) to see if you get a\nmessage (in PT maybe use simulation mode to see syslog packet). If not possible, conceptually\nensure you know how to do it.\nLab 9.4: SNMP (optional)  \u2013 Configure a simple SNMP community on a router ( snmp-server\ncommunity PUBLIC RO ) and use a PC with a network monitoring tool (PT might not have that)\n\u2013 if not, skip actual test, just know the config.\nLab 9.5: End-to-End Network Build  \u2013 As a final project for Month 3, build a small company\nnetwork: 2 departments on separate VLANs (use a switch and router-on-stick or multilayer\nswitch for inter-VLAN), include a DHCP server for clients, use NAT on the edge router to an \u201cISP\u201d,\nrun OSPF on internal routers if multiple. Also implement an ACL (access control list) as a simple\nfirewall to allow internal to outside, but block certain port maybe (we\u2019ll do ACL more next week,\nbut you can preview). Essentially, combine multiple technologies into one coherent network.\nDocument the network diagram and configurations as if preparing for a handover to another\nengineer . Expected Outcome:  A multi-faceted network that mirrors a simplified enterprise:\nVLANs, routing (static or OSPF), NAT for internet, DHCP for hosts, etc. This is a synthesis exercise\nand also good practice for the capstone next month.\n(Project) Documentation  and  Diagrams:  Take  one  of  your  recent  labs  (like  the  NAT/DHCP\nnetwork) and create a professional-looking network diagram using a tool (Lucidchart, draw.io, or\neven  Packet  Tracer\u2019s  drawing  tools).  Label  VLANs,  IPs,  device  names.  Write  a  brief  network\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n28\n\ndocumentation  (couple  paragraphs)  describing  the  topology  and  addressing  scheme.  This\npractices the soft skill of documentation \u2013 very important for a network engineer .\nQuizzes/Assessments:\nDHCP/NAT Quiz:  ~15 questions. Example topics: DHCP message sequence, function of DHCP\nrelay, configuring DHCP pool options (like default-router command), NAT inside vs outside\nmeaning, how PAT differentiates flows (port numbers), identify NAT addresses given a translation\n(inside local/global definitions), etc. Possibly a scenario: \u201cHost can\u2019t get DHCP address \u2013 which\ncommand is missing?\u201d or \u201cAfter configuring NAT, inside hosts still can\u2019t reach out \u2013 what could be\nwrong?\u201d (like forgot ACL for NAT, or mis-set inside/outside interface).\nServices Quiz:  ~10 questions covering NTP (purpose, maybe which stratum or which port),\nSNMP (which version is secure? v3), Syslog (which level is Emergency? difference between level 0\nand 7), QoS (maybe one question: \u201cWhat does QoS classification mean?\u201d).\nSecurity intro Quiz:  Because next week is Security, maybe preview with a couple of simple Qs\nnow: e.g., \u201cWhat is the purpose of an ACL?\u201d, \u201cWhich command enables SSH on a Cisco\nswitch?\u201d (for review if you did it), just to start thinking on security.\nFlashcards: Summarize NAT types, default ports for services (FTP 21, SSH 22, etc \u2013 not sure if\nCCNA requires memorizing many ports, but a handful of common ones is good), syslog levels (0\nEmergencies, 7 Debug), SNMP vs Syslog uses, and QoS terms (like congestion avoidance vs\ncongestion management, again maybe beyond CCNA detail).\nTime Allocation (~13 hours):\n- Videos: ~2 hours (services configs)\n- Reading: ~3 hours (multiple small topics to cover)\n- Labs: ~6 hours (lots of practical configuration this week)\n- Quizzes/Review: ~2 hours (covering various services, which might be lighter individually but many\ntopics)\nMilestones & Checkpoints:\n-  Milestone 1:  Configure a DHCP server on a router and verify clients get addresses. Show a sample\nclient IP config (from  ipconfig  in PT PC or just show dhcp binding) and ensure gateway/DNS is\ncorrectly  delivered.  If  something  failed,  note  how  you  fixed  it  (e.g.,  forgot  the  default-router\ncommand initially).\n-  Milestone  2:  Implement  PAT  and  demonstrate  an  inside  host  reaching  an  outside  host.  Use\nshow  ip  nat  translations  to  present  one  example  of  a  translation  (e.g.,\n192.168.10.5:12345 -> 203.0.113.2:randomPort ).  Be  able  to  explain  which  is  inside  local/\nglobal . If static NAT, show that outside can reach inside using the static mapping.\n- Milestone 3:  Set up NTP in lab or at least configure ntp server x.x.x.x  on a router . Confirm time\nsync (maybe use  debug ntp  if possible or  show ntp associations ). If not feasible, state the\ncommands used and expected result.\n- Milestone 4:  Write down in your notes an \u201cIP Services summary\u201d covering DHCP (ports 67/68, DORA),\nNAT (terms and commands), NTP (basics of client/server), SNMP (v2c vs v3), Syslog (levels 0-7), TFTP/FTP\nuse cases, and SSH vs Telnet difference. This is your cheat-sheet for quick recall.\n- Milestone 5:  Achieve 80%+ combined on the services quizzes. These are straightforward if you labbed\n\u2013 e.g., NAT can be confusing but if you practiced, it\u2019s okay. Clarify any missed concept by re-reading that\nbit of Odom or using device outputs to understand.\n-  Checkpoint:  Now  the  core  network  engineering  skills  are  in  place  \u2013  you\u2019ve  handled  network\nfundamentals, switching, routing, and essential services. The remaining blueprint domains are Security\nand Automation, which we\u2019ll cover in Month 4 and 5, along with lots of review and practice. Reflect on\nhow many configs you can now do: from VLANs to OSPF to NAT. That\u2019s huge! Ensure all your lab files\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n104\n29\n\nand notes are organized \u2013 you might start revisiting them for exam review soon. Take a well-earned\nbreak and gear up for Security topics next.\nMotivation:  Three months down \u2013 you\u2019re halfway through the timeline and have covered the lion\u2019s share\nof technical topics. It\u2019s normal if some things still feel complicated (OSPF or NAT confusions linger), but\nyou have time to refine via reviews and more practice. The key is: you\u2019ve built a robust foundation . In\nthe next months, we\u2019ll reinforce it with advanced topics and lots of reviews. Keep pushing forward;\nyou\u2019re doing fantastic. Also, maybe start engaging with others (online forums, study groups) to test\nyour knowledge by answering questions \u2013 teaching is a great test of mastery. On to Month 4!"

Configure these on a lab router/switch.\n- Understand AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting)  concepts : not configure in depth\n(that\u2019s CCNP), but know that AAA can use local or external (RADIUS/TACACS+ servers). Understand how a\nCisco device can use a central server to authenticate admins. Possibly configure a simple local AAA\nauthentication for login as practice.\n- Configure  SSH on a Cisco device: generate RSA keys, set up username/password or AAA, and verify\nSSH login. Ensure Telnet is disabled (only SSH allowed).\n- Implement Port Security  on a switch : limit MAC addresses on a port (e.g., only allow one MAC and\nshutdown if violation). Test by connecting a different device to see the violation.\n- Implement ACLs (Access Control Lists)  on a router : Standard ACL vs Extended ACL differences.\nPractice creating a standard ACL to filter traffic (e.g., block one network from accessing another) and an\nextended ACL (e.g., permit HTTP but block Telnet). Apply ACLs inbound or outbound on interfaces\nappropriately and test.\n- Understand ACL best practices  and how they\u2019re used for security (basic firewalling) and for control\nplane (e.g., line VTY ACL to limit who can SSH).\n- Cover Device login banners  (MOTD) for legal warning, and the concept of physical security (briefly).\n- This week is heavy on configuration \u2013 it solidifies as you do it practically.\nResources:\n- Videos/Tutorials:\n- Jeremy\u2019s IT Lab Day 4 Lab \u2013 Basic Device Security  (YouTube, ~10 min) \u2013 likely covers setting console/\nVTY passwords, service password-encryption, etc., which you did partly in Month1 but review now with\nsecurity lens.\n- Keith Barker \u201cSSH Configuration\u201d  (YouTube, 8 min) \u2013 quick steps to enable SSH on a Cisco router/\nswitch.\n-  NetworkChuck \u201cPort Security\u201d  (YouTube, 10 min) \u2013 demonstration of setting up port security and44\n45\n105\n51\n50\n30\n\nshowing what happens on violation (with his typical energetic style, possibly caffeinated example).\n- CBT Nuggets \u201cStandard vs Extended ACL\u201d  (if access, ~10 min) \u2013 explains the difference and perhaps a\nscenario of each. Otherwise, try a free video by David Bombal on configuring ACLs.\n-  Kevin Wallace \u201cACL Wildcard Masking\u201d  (YouTube, 5 min) \u2013 understanding wildcard masks in ACL\n(inversion of subnet mask). Many beginners find wildcard confusing, so ensure you get it.\n-  (Optional) \u201cAAA and RADIUS/TACACS+\u201d  (Network Direction on YT, ~15 min) \u2013 to conceptualize AAA.\nCCNA might only ask e.g., \u201cWhat is an advantage of TACACS+ over RADIUS?\u201d or \u201cWhich port does\nRADIUS use?\u201d \u2013 maybe too deep, but know TACACS+ is Cisco, TCP, encrypts full payload; RADIUS is UDP,\nencrypts only password. Minor details.\nBooks/Chapters:\nCCNA Cert Guide (Vol. 2)  \u2013 Read the Security Fundamentals chapter(s). Key topics: securing\ndevice access (passwords, SSH), Layer 2 security (port security, DHCP snooping, DAI), basics of\nVPNs (definition of site-to-site vs remote access) , and intro to AAA. Odom likely also covers\ndevice monitoring (like SNMP which we did) and an intro to network attacks (DoS, phishing, etc.)\n\u2013 know basic definitions of threats  and mitigations. Also read about ACLs  thoroughly \u2013\nstandard ACL (numbered 1-99 or named), extended ACL (100-199 or named), and where to place\nthem (standard close to destination, extended close to source typically).\nEnsure to cover Layer 2 security : Odom will mention DHCP Snooping, ARP Inspection, Port Security\nas in blueprint . Understand what each does: DHCP Snooping prevents rogue DHCP servers;\nDAI relies on snooping to block fake ARP; Port Security limits MACs to prevent CAM table\noverflow attacks.\nThere might be mention of WLAN security  here (blueprint has WPA/WPA2/WPA3) \u2013 recall from\nearlier and know the differences (WPA2 uses AES-CCMP, WPA3 adds SAE, etc., but just basics).\nPossibly an overview of  Network Attack types  \u2013 e.g., VLAN hopping, spoofing, man-in-the-\nmiddle, etc., with mitigations. If present, read to be able to name a few common ones.\nResearch Papers/Articles:\nCisco Guide: \u201cConfiguring Secure Management Access\u201d  \u2013 covers SSH setup, role-based CLI\nmaybe. Focus on SSH and strong passwords parts.\nCisco Port Security Best Practices  \u2013 find an article listing recommendations (like stick to one\nMAC per port for user ports, use violation shutdown).\nSANS paper on ACLs  \u2013 possibly, or just recall from earlier reading.\nCommon threats  \u2013 maybe a blog \u201cTop 5 network attacks and how to prevent\u201d to broaden your\nunderstanding: e.g., MAC flooding (countered by port security), DHCP spoofing (counter by\nDHCP Snooping), ARP poisoning (counter by DAI), etc.\nCisco Whitepaper: \u201cNetwork Security Fundamentals\u201d  \u2013 if any summary doc exists. Might\nreinforce CIA triad concept (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) \u2013 not sure if CCNA explicitly\ncovers that, but could mention if context arises.\nOnline Courses:\nCisco NetAcad \u2013 ENSA Module on Network Security : They have chapters on Access Control,\nperhaps AAA, VPN overview, etc. Do any Packet Tracer labs on ACLs (there\u2019s often a PT \u201cConfigure\nand Verify ACLs\u201d).\nPacket Tracer Activities  \u2013 Check PT for pre-made activities like \u201cPort Security\u201d or \u201cSecure\nNetwork Device\u201d \u2013 sometimes there are. \u2022\n\u2022\n106\n41\n\u2022\n52\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n31\n\nCybrary/Free Cybersercurity content  \u2013 if you want more theory, but for CCNA probably not\nneeded beyond core principles.\nHands-On Labs/Projects:\nLab 10.1: Secure Management Config  \u2013 Take a lab router/switch, configure: an enable secret,\nlocal user account with privilege 15, console login using local, VTY login using local with\ntransport input SSH only, generate RSA keys, and test SSH from a PC. Also set service\npassword-encryption  (so your line passwords are encrypted in config). Finally, set a login\nbanner (MOTD). Expected Outcome:  You can only access the device via SSH with the correct\nuser/pass, and console also requires login. The config should show encrypted passwords.\nDocument these steps as if making a checklist (will be useful later).\nLab 10.2: Port Security Demo  \u2013 On a switch, pick an access port connected to a PC. Configure\nswitchport port-security  (default allows one MAC) and maybe violation shutdown .\nConnect the PC, see it works. Now disconnect that PC and connect a different device (or change\nthe MAC in PT by replacing the NIC or using another PC). The port should go into err-disable.\nCheck show port-security interface X  to see the violation count. Then re-enable the\nport ( shutdown/no shutdown ) and possibly set it to violation protect  mode to see\ndifference (in protect, won\u2019t shut, but drops unknown MAC traffic). Expected Outcome:\nUnderstanding how port security can block devices beyond the first.\nLab 10.3: ACL Practice  \u2013 a) Standard ACL : On a router with two subnets (A and B), create a\nstandard ACL to block traffic from one specific host or subnet A from reaching subnet B. Apply it\ninbound on interface toward B. Test with pings: the blocked host should fail, others succeed. b)\nExtended ACL : e.g., block HTTP from one network to a server , but allow other traffic. Use an\nextended ACL applied appropriately. Alternatively, implement an ACL on VTY lines to allow only a\nspecific IP range to telnet/SSH to the router (for management plane security). Expected\nOutcome:  You can write ACL statements (with correct wildcard masks, host vs any keywords)\nand apply them correctly (right interface, right direction) to achieve desired filtering. Use show\naccess-lists  to see hit counts after tests.\nLab 10.4: Layer 2 Security  \u2013 If Packet Tracer supports, try enabling DHCP Snooping  on a switch\n(specify trusted ports vs untrusted) and then simulate a rogue DHCP (PT might not easily\nsimulate rogue server , but you can place a second DHCP server in a VLAN and see if snooping\nblocks it). Similarly, DAI needs ARP packets \u2013 may skip actual test, but know config. If not\nfeasible, at least review how to enable those (e.g., ip dhcp snooping  globally and per VLAN).\nLab 10.5: Wireless Security  \u2013 On a wireless router/AP in PT, try setting different security modes\n(WEP, WPA2, etc.) to see how a client connects with each. Note how a weak security (like WEP)\ncould be cracked (just conceptually). If possible, show that without knowing passphrase, client\ncan\u2019t connect \u2013 obvious, but demonstrates necessity of proper Wi-Fi auth.\n(Project) Security Audit Checklist:  Create a checklist for securing a small network device: e.g., \u201c1.\nSet enable secret, 2. Disable unused ports or put in unused VLAN, 3. Apply port security on\naccess ports, 4. Use SSH not Telnet, 5. Use strong passwords and maybe AAA, 6. Implement ACLs\nto limit access to network segments, 7. Enable logging and NTP for time sync (for accurate logs),\netc.\u201d This can be compiled from Cisco best practices. Use this list to verify your own labs have no\nglaring holes.\nQuizzes/Assessments:\nDevice Security Quiz:  ~10 questions \u2013 e.g., \u201cWhich command encrypts all plaintext passwords in\nconfig?\u201d (service password-encryption), \u201cWhat does AAA stand for?\u201d, \u201cWhat is the default violation\nmode of port security?\u201d (shutdown), \u201cHow many MACs by default if not specified?\u201d (1), etc. \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n32\n\nACL Quiz:  ~10 questions \u2013 test understanding of wildcards (like \u201cWhich wildcard matches\n192.168.5.0/255.255.255.0?\u201d answer 0.0.0.255), order of ACL, extended ACL format (src/dst IP and\nports), maybe identify what an ACL will do from lines given.\nSecurity Concepts Quiz:  ~10 questions \u2013 cover general: difference between threat, vulnerability,\nexploit ; VPN types  (just definition of site-to-site vs remote-access), wireless security\ndifferences, AAA differences (TACACS+ vs RADIUS), maybe one on CIA triad or social engineering.\nPrevious domains mixed quiz:  Add 5-10 questions from routing/switching to keep memory\nfresh (maybe you can take a small mixed practice test from a site/book).\nFlashcards: Terms to memorize: e.g., \u201cDHCP Snooping \u2013 prevents rogue server\u201d, \u201cport security\ndefault aging: what? (by default secure MAC doesn\u2019t age out unless configured)\u201d, \u201cStandard ACL\nrange (1-99)\u201d, \u201cExtended ACL range (100-199)\u201d, \u201cWell-known ports: 20/21 FTP, 22 SSH, 23 Telnet,\n53 DNS, 69 TFTP, 80 HTTP, 443 HTTPS, 161 SNMP, etc., to answer any odd question or just to\nknow for ACL port filters)\u201d. Also maybe \u201cWPA3 uses SAE (Dragonfly handshake)\u201d.\nTime Allocation (~13 hours):\n- Videos: ~2 hours\n- Reading: ~3 hours (security chapters)\n- Labs: ~5-6 hours (multiple short config labs)\n- Quizzes/Review: ~2 hours\nMilestones & Checkpoints:\n- Milestone 1:  Harden a device and verify: e.g., a switch that only allows SSH login with a specific user ,\nand has console secured. Attempt to telnet (should fail), attempt SSH with wrong user (fail), right user\n(success). If possible, get a peer to try to \u201cbreak in\u201d (or just simulate by trying defaults) to ensure it\u2019s\nsecure.\n- Milestone 2:  Successfully use port security to shut down a port on unauthorized device connection.\nCheck that you know how to bring it back ( errdisable recovery  or manual shut/no shut).\n-  Milestone 3:  Implemented ACLs that work as intended. Document one example: \u201cStandard ACL 10\nblocking Network X applied on interface G0/0 inbound blocked traffic successfully as shown by ping\ntests.\u201d Also note ACL best practice (like placing, and remember implicit deny at end).\n-  Milestone 4:  Quick-fire: be able to answer \u201cHow to mitigate X?\u201d for the common threats: e.g., MAC\nflooding -> Port Security, rogue DHCP -> DHCP Snooping, ARP Poisoning -> DAI, brute-force on device ->\nstrong passwords & login delay, etc. You don\u2019t need to know deep, just a one-liner mitigation.\n- Milestone 5:  Achieve ~80% across security quizzes. If there\u2019s any term or tech you missed, review it.\nFor instance, if you blanked on \u201cwhat does SNMPv3 add\u201d (security), just note it down. If ACL logic\nconfused you (like order of lines or implicit deny), clarify with more practice.\n- Checkpoint:  At this point, you have completed an initial pass through all CCNA domains . Congrats!\nYou likely have a pile of notes, lab configs, and flashcards. For the remainder of Month 4 and in Month\n5, we\u2019ll focus on  automation  plus heavy  review and practice exams  to solidify everything. Use this\ncheckpoint to identify your weakest areas \u2013 maybe it\u2019s OSPF, or ACLs, or subnetting under time. Flag\nthem for extra attention in coming weeks.\nMotivation:  Security can be detail-heavy, but you\u2019ve grasped how to lock down a network which is a\ncritical skill. It\u2019s satisfying to break and then secure something. Remember , skills like ACLs and port\nsecurity are not only exam topics but practical tools  \u2013 your future network engineer self will thank\nyou for mastering them now. Keep those study habits strong; you\u2019re in the home stretch of content\ncoverage.  Month  5  will  introduce  the  final  piece  (Automation)  and  then  it\u2019s  all  about  integrating\nknowledge and practice tests.\u2022\n\u2022\n41 107\n\u2022\n\u2022\n33"

        "title": "Automation & Programmability Fundamentals",
        "content": "Objectives (Week 11):\n- Grasp why network automation  and programmability are emerging: the need for scale, consistency,\nand integration with DevOps. Understand terms like SDN (Software-Defined Networking)  \u2013 separating\ncontrol plane and data plane, and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)  \u2013 how software can interact\nwith network devices.\n- Learn about REST APIs  in the context of networking: e.g., Cisco\u2019s RESTful APIs (like those on Cisco\nDNA Center or even some on IOS-XE). Understand what CRUD means (Create, Read, Update, Delete)\nand that these map to HTTP verbs (POST, GET, PUT/PATCH, DELETE).\n- Get exposure to data formats like  JSON  (JavaScript Object Notation) and maybe XML \u2013 CCNA\nexpects you to recognize JSON output and basic structure (key:value pairs, nested). Practice reading a\nJSON snippet and locating a piece of data (like an IP address in a JSON of interface info).\n- Explore  network automation tools : Know of Puppet, Chef, Ansible (just what they are, not how to\nuse) . Ansible is popular for network automation (YAML playbooks). Puppet/Chef are more used in\nserver world but Cisco wants you aware.\n- Basic scripting intro: write a very simple  Python script  to retrieve or configure something, or just\nparse some output. If you\u2019re new to coding, at least understand a provided Python script that uses a\nlibrary like netmiko  or requests to call a REST API. We won\u2019t become coders in a week, but break the\nice.\n- Use Cisco\u2019s DevNet resources if possible: maybe use the Cisco DevNet sandbox or their always-on\nsandboxes for DNA Center or CSR1000v API to try a sample API call (alternatively, use Packet Tracer\u2019s\nnew REST-based multiuser feature if exists, or just conceptual).\n- Tie back to exam: ensure you can answer conceptual Qs like \u201cWhat is the benefit of controller-based\nnetworking?\u201d , \u201cWhat is an example of southbound API vs northbound API?\u201d  (Southbound: e.g.,\nOpenFlow, NETCONF; Northbound: REST API to controller). Recognize JSON and interpret it.\n- This week is more about reading/understanding than heavy lab, unless you\u2019re comfortable to try some\ncoding.\nResources:\n- Videos/Tutorials:\n-  Cisco DevNet \u201cNetworking 101: APIs\u201d  (YouTube, ~10 min) \u2013 an explanation by Hank Preston or\nsimilar about using APIs in network management.\n- NetworkChuck \u201cREST APIs for Beginners\u201d  (YouTube, 15 min) \u2013 not network specific, but covers what\nan API is in simple terms, using maybe a public API example.\n-  David Bombal \u201cJSON and Postman for CCNA\u201d  (YouTube, ~20 min) \u2013 David often covers new CCNA\ntopics; he may have one showing how to use Postman (an API client) to query a Cisco controller and get\nJSON data. This could be very practical to watch.\n- \u201cSDN and Controllers\u201d  by Keith Barker (YouTube, ~12 min) \u2013 conceptual explanation of SDN and Cisco\nDNA Center as an example, plus traditional vs SDN differences.\n- CBT Nuggets \u201cAutomation and Programmability Basics\u201d  (if access) \u2013 might have a high-level video\nsummarizing these emerging tech within CCNA scope.\n- (Optional) \u201cPython for Network Engineers Crash\u201d  (YouTube, e.g., by Kirk Byers or others, 1 hour or\nmore) \u2013 only if you have time/interest to go deeper . Focus on simpler: how to open a SSH connection\nwith netmiko, or parse an IP from a text using Python regex. But that may be beyond what\u2019s needed.\nBooks/Chapters:\nCCNA Cert Guide (Vol. 2)  \u2013 The last chapter(s) on Automation & Programmability. Read all\nsections: Network Architectures (controller-based vs traditional), APIs (northbound/southbound),\nconfiguration management tools (just understand they manage configs and ensure desired108\n109\n61\n65\n63\n110 58\n\u2022\n\u2022\n34\n\nstate), Cisco DNA Center & SD-Access overview (fabric, overlay/underlay concepts from blueprint)\n, JSON data format (they might show an example and point out how to pick values) .\nThere might also be mention of model-driven programmability (YANG models, NETCONF) \u2013 just\nnote those words, maybe one exam Q.\nCisco DevNet Assoc. book  (if any excerpt is available) \u2013 might have overlapping content with\nCCNA automation section for deeper interest.\nAppendix or Additional Reading:  Odom might reference some DevNet resources; check if any\nrecommended reading on JSON or APIs.\nResearch Papers/Articles:\nCisco Whitepaper: \u201cIntent-Based Networking\u201d  \u2013 describes concept behind controllers like DNA\nCenter (which uses intent-based policies). Good to get buzzwords like \u201cintent, automation,\nassurance\u201d.\nBlog: \u201cAPIs for Network Engineers\u201d  \u2013 a blog by a network engineer who learned Python,\nexplaining how they use REST APIs to get device info.\nJSON tutorial  \u2013 lots online, but maybe an interactive one where you view a JSON example. If not,\neven Wikipedia JSON page shows an example to interpret.\nDevNet \u201cHello Network!\u201d lab  \u2013 if you register on Cisco DevNet (free), they have some guided\nlabs on using sandbox. Maybe try \u201cREST API Basics\u201d or \u201cAlways-On Sandbox demo\u201d.\nOpenFlow overview  \u2013 just read what OpenFlow is historically (protocol for controllers to\nprogram switches \u2013 used in early SDN, now not as talked, but part of history).\nTerraform/Chef/Puppet  \u2013 no need detail, just know these are Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools,\nbeyond CCNA likely.\nOnline Courses:\nCisco NetAcad \u2013 DevNet Associate course  (if available, not sure if free). If accessible, might\nhave beginner labs on using Postman to query Cisco DNA.\nPostman or curl practice : If you have access to a network device with API (maybe PT doesn\u2019t\nhave, but you could install Cisco Packet Tracer and see if it supports some API?), alternative: use\na dummy public API (like a weather API) in Postman just to get comfortable with GET/POST and\nsee JSON.\nCoding practice : if new to Python, perhaps use an interactive site like Codecademy for a couple\nof Python lessons just so you can read code. But time is short; if you already code a bit, maybe\nattempt something small like using Python to read a JSON file.\nHands-On Labs/Projects:\nLab 11.1: Explore a REST API  \u2013 Use a tool like Postman (install on your computer) or Python\nrequests  library to GET data from an API. If you don\u2019t have a Cisco device API, use something\nlike httpbin or a dummy JSON API. Alternatively, many Cisco devices have an HTTP interface you\ncould enable (not secure, but for test). If you can, enable REST API on a DevNet sandbox or\nCSR1000v VM (this might be advanced \u2013 if not, skip doing it yourself). At least, open a sample\nJSON file (maybe Odom\u2019s book has one, or find on DevNet) and try to pick out key info. Expected\nOutcome:  You understand how an API call returns structured data (JSON) and how it differs\nfrom CLI show output. 108 65\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n35\n\nLab 11.2: Simple Python Script  \u2013 Write or copy a short script that does something like \u201cprint all\nIP addresses in this JSON\u201d or \u201cSSH to router and run show ip int brief (using netmiko)\u201d. If you\u2019ve\nnever coded, ask a programmer friend or find a ready script from DevNet Code Exchange.\nRunning it successfully and seeing output is the goal. If not comfortable, at least go through the\nthought: how would automation save time vs manual CLI (imagine configuring 100 VLANs on 10\nswitches \u2013 script can do it faster with less error).\nLab 11.3: Controller Demo  \u2013 If possible, watch a demo or recording of Cisco DNA Center or\nPacket Tracer\u2019s SDN Controller (PT has a \u201cController\u201d object for SDN but not sure how functional).\nAt least conceptually: one central controller can push VLAN configs to all switches or do dynamic\npath optimization. Recognize how this differs from logging individually.\nLab 11.4: JSON Parsing Exercise  \u2013 Create a small JSON structure (or use sample) that includes\nnetwork info, e.g.: {\"interface\": \"Gig0/1\", \"ip_address\": \"10.0.0.1\", \"status\":\n\"up\"}. Write down how you\u2019d access the IP address field (answer: by key \"ip_address\"). Maybe\ntest with a Python one-liner if possible: import json; data=json.loads(<jsonstring>);\nprint(data[\"interface\"])  to print values. Expected Outcome:  Not to memorize syntax but\nto demystify JSON (it\u2019s just text with keys/values, often easier than parsing CLI output).\n(Project) Automation Strategy Proposal:  Imagine you manage 50 switches \u2013 list 3 tasks you\nwould  script/automate  (e.g.,  backup  configs  nightly,  bulk  update  SNMP  community,  verify\ninterfaces up). For each, describe how automation helps (less error , schedule it, etc.). This isn\u2019t on\nexam, but thinking this way prepares you for real network engineering in modern environments\nand gives context to why Cisco added this domain.\nQuizzes/Assessments:\nAutomation Concepts Quiz:  ~10-15 questions. Cover north vs southbound API, e.g., \u201cWhich is a\nsouthbound API? a) REST to DNA Center , b) NETCONF to routers, c) web dashboard GUI\n(northbound example).\u201d Ask about benefits of automation (fewer errors, consistency, speed).\nMaybe \u201cWhich data format is easiest for machines to parse? JSON vs XML vs YAML \u2013 arguably\nJSON/YAML both fine, but JSON is ubiquitous). Some basic Python logic like \u201cwhich of these is a\ncorrect list syntax in Python?\u201d or maybe not \u2013 CCNA not a coding test but might have pseudo-\ncode trace (but rarely). If any question, likely identify JSON vs XML or a Python snippet output.\nFor instance, they may show a JSON and ask \u201cwhat is the value of X key?\u201d \u2013 test if you can read\nJSON. Or a Python print(data[\"ip\"])  and ask what it does (print the value of \"ip\" key from\ndata dictionary). If you\u2019ve done above exercises, you\u2019d get it.\nDevOps Tool Quiz:  ~5 questions \u2013 maybe matching \u201cPuppet/Chef\u201d to \u201cuses declarative manifests\nand agent on nodes\u201d vs \u201cAnsible uses SSH, agentless, uses YAML playbooks\u201d vs \u201cSaltStack, etc.\u201d If\nCCNA doesn\u2019t go deep, maybe one question: \u201cWhich tool uses a push model? (Ansible) vs pull\nmodel (Puppet)\u201d. But likely just identify these as automation/config management tools.\nFull-length Practice Exam #1:  This is a good point to take a full CCNA practice exam  (60-70\nquestions, 2 hours). Use Boson ExSim if you have it (highly recommended ) or the Cisco\nOfficial Practice if available, or a free one (ExamTopics \u2013 but caution, verify answers). Simulate\nexam conditions: 120 min timer , no notes. Afterward, grade and analyze every question , especially\nthe ones you got wrong or guessed. This will highlight any weak areas to focus on in Week 12\nand Month 5 review.\nContinue Flashcards: add any new ones (like \u201cAPI = Application Programming Interface, allows\nsoftware to communicate via defined requests\u201d, \u201cCRUD = Create,Read,Update,Delete\u201d, sample\nJSON syntax). Also maybe flashcard any facts you got wrong in practice exam. By now, flashcards\nshould be a sizable deck \u2013 keep doing daily reviews; it\u2019s a great retention tool up to exam day. \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n111 112\n\u2022\n36\n\nTime Allocation (~12 hours):\n- Videos: ~2 hours\n- Reading/learning: ~3 hours\n- Hands-on (if doing script/API calls): ~3 hours (maybe more if really diving, adjust as needed)\n- Practice Exam and review: ~4 hours (2h exam, 2h review)\nMilestones & Checkpoints:\n-  Milestone  1:  Write  a  short  explanation  (4-5  sentences)  of  the  difference  between  traditional\nnetworking vs controller-based. E.g., \u201cTraditional: each device configured individually (CLI), control plane\ndistributed; Controller-based: central brain (controller) tells devices how to forward, devices are simpler ,\neasier to enforce policies network-wide.\u201d If you can articulate that, you got the core idea .\n-  Milestone  2:  Interpret  a  given  JSON.  For  instance,  take:  {\"device\": {\"name\": \"R1\",\n\"interfaces\":  [{\"name\":  \"Gig0/0\",  \"ip\":\"10.0.0.1\"},\n{\"name\":\"Gig0/1\",\"ip\":\"10.0.1.1\"}]}} . Answer: how many interfaces does R1 have and what\nare their IPs? (Should be: 2 interfaces, IPs 10.0.0.1 and 10.0.1.1). If you can do that, you\u2019re good for JSON\ninterpretation .\n- Milestone 3:  (Optional but cool) Successfully run a simple network automation action \u2013 whether it\u2019s an\nAPI GET retrieving something or using a script to login and run a command. If accomplished, celebrate\n\u2013 you\u2019ve stepped into netprog! If not, at least know what such a script would generally look like.\n- Milestone 4:  Complete the full practice exam and identify improvement areas. Suppose you scored,\nsay, 70% \u2013 not bad for first full attempt; list which sections had wrong answers. Make a plan to review\nthose (which we\u2019ll do Week 12 and Month 5). If you scored 90% \u2013 great, but still review any misses and\nnote if it was luck on some guesses; ensure those are solidified.\n-  Checkpoint:  Content  learning  phase  is  nearly  done.  All  topics  are  covered.  The  focus  shifts  to\nreinforcing knowledge, practicing scenarios, and test readiness . Compare where you were at Month\n1 vs now \u2013 impressive progress, right? The next step: refine until you\u2019re consistently exam-ready and\nconfident  in  practical  skills  too.  Use  Month  5  for  that  polishing,  plus  a  capstone  project  to  apply\neverything.\nMotivation:  Automation is a new frontier \u2013 don\u2019t worry if you felt like a newbie again here. The CCNA only\ndips a toe into programmability; mastery comes with practice over time. The key takeaway is you now\nknow what\u2019s possible  and won\u2019t be intimidated by terms like JSON or API in the field. Embrace a growth\nmindset \u2013 network engineering is evolving and so are you. Now, let\u2019s gear up for the final phase: intense\nreview, practice tests, and a big capstone lab to ensure you\u2019re more than ready for the exam and the job\nmarket."

        "title": "Comprehensive Review and Mock Exam",
        "content": "Objectives (Week 12):\n- Systematic review  of all domains: Each day of this week, focus on one domain\u2019s key points and \u201cmust-\nknow\u201d facts/configs. E.g., Day1: Network Fundamentals recap, Day2: Network Access recap, etc. Use\nyour notes, flashcards, and maybe re-watch 2x speed videos or skim chapters to reinforce.\n- Identify and fill any remaining gaps: If certain labs were skipped or still shaky (maybe IPv6 or OSPF\narea type details), address them now with quick labs or reading.\n- Take at least one more full-length mock exam  (preferably a different set of questions than week 11\u2019s).\nAim to exceed the passing score margin (target ~90% so you have cushion).\n- Practice Simulations and practical scenarios : If you have access to simulation-style questions (like\nconfiguring  something  under  time),  practice  a  couple.  If  not,  create  your  own  mini-scenarios  to\nconfigure without looking at guides (like: \u201cConfigure OSPF on these routers, with passive interface on\nLAN, and default route advertisement \u2013 go!\u201d and see if you can do it quickly).\n-  Refine  test-taking  strategies:  manage  time  (approx  1  min/question,  more  for  sim),  flag  tough110\n65\n37\n\nquestions and move on, eliminate wrong answers in MCQs by logic, etc. Train your brain to stay calm\nand methodical during the exam.\n- Ensure you are ready with practical skills as well: though CCNA is theory + some sim, for job readiness,\nensure you can do the common tasks without peeking at notes now.\n- By end of week, be exam-ready and also ready to apply knowledge in a capstone project next month.\nResources:\n- Videos:\n- Watch any \u201cLast minute CCNA review\u201d videos (there are often 1-2 hour marathon reviews on YouTube\nsummarizing key points). E.g., \u201cCCNA in 120 minutes\u201d type videos \u2013 good for high-level catch-all revision.\n- Exam tips videos  (many CCNA mentors have \u201ctips to pass\u201d with advice on question wording, how to\nnot overthink, etc.). This might ease anxiety and give insight on Cisco\u2019s style.\n- If certain topics still fuzzy, revisit those specific video sections at higher speed for clarity.\nReading:\nSkim through your compiled notes and highlight anything you\u2019d hesitate on if asked outright. If\nyou find any, clarify immediately (look up that detail).\nRe-read the exam blueprint list we compiled at the beginning. Can you give a sentence or two\nabout each sub-bullet if asked? If not, review those.\nIf you have the Odom books, the end-of-book \u201cKey Topics\u201d and \u201cDo I Know This Already\u201d quizzes\nare excellent for quick review. Use those as a checklist.\nPractice exams:\nBoson ExSim \u2013 do Exam B (if you did A earlier) under exam conditions. Review thoroughly.\nPearson/Cisco Official Practice exam (if you have it).\nTake some free online quizzes for variety (careful with brain dump sites; better use reputable\nones like Todd Lammle\u2019s site or others with practice Qs).\nIf scoring consistently ~85%+, that\u2019s a good sign. If below ~80%, identify why \u2013 content gap or\ntricky wording? Fix content gaps and practice interpreting wording (dissect what the question\nreally asks).\nLab practice:\nQuickly lab any config that you don\u2019t feel second-nature: e.g., \u201cSetting up trunk + EtherChannel\u201d\nquickly, or \u201cOne static NAT and one PAT\u201d quickly. This just builds muscle memory and confidence.\nIf possible, do a timed lab: e.g., give yourself 30 minutes to configure a small network from\nscratch (3 routers OSPF + 2 VLANs + NAT, etc.). This isn\u2019t for exam (they won\u2019t be that extensive\ndue to time), but for you to consolidate integration of topics.\nEnsure you know how to verify and troubleshoot in labs swiftly: e.g., commands like  ping,\ntraceroute ,  show ip int brief ,  show cdp neighbors , etc., should come to mind\neasily to diagnose things, because some exam sims might require troubleshooting a misconfig.\nFlashcards:\nBy now you have many flashcards \u2013 keep reviewing daily, but also start trimming ones you\nalways get right (or mark them as known). Focus on ones you still slip on. \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n38\n\nThe day before exam (in plan, that\u2019s next month), you might just skim through all to ensure\nnothing forgotten.\nHealth/Mental Prep:\nThis is part of review week too: Plan your exam logistics (if you intend to take it right after Month\n5, schedule it now so you have a date !). Having it scheduled will drive you.\nEnsure you get good rest and not burn out this week \u2013 if you study too hard without breaks,\nretention drops. Take short breaks, stay hydrated, exercise a bit.\nPractice some mindfulness or positive visualization: imagine opening your exam result with a\npass \u2013 that\u2019s motivating and calms nerves.\nMilestones & Checkpoints:\n- Milestone 1:  Score well on Mock Exam(s). For instance, if Boson exam gives scores per section, ensure\nnone of the six domains is below ~80%. If one is, revisit that domain\u2019s content until you can raise it.\n-  Milestone 2:  Conduct a thorough  self-assessment : Print out (or write down) each exam blueprint\ntopic and rate your confidence 1-5. For any 3 or below, do a targeted review. After review, all should be 4\nor 5 (meaning \u201cI could answer an exam question or do a basic lab on this\u201d).\n- Milestone 3:  Complete a final lab or troubleshoot challenge without hints, successfully. For example,\npurposely break something in a network (like an OSPF area mismatch or an ACL blocking a service) and\nsee if you can find and fix it quickly. This shows you can apply knowledge dynamically, which is great for\njob skills.\n- Milestone 4:  Organize your study materials for next month\u2019s capstone and job prep: e.g., have your\nbest notes and diagrams ready to refer to when designing the final project and for interview prep (it\u2019s\nhandy to show or at least talk about a project with documentation).\n- Checkpoint:  You should now feel ready to schedule or soon take the CCNA exam . If not, identify what\u2019s\nholding you back \u2013 content, test anxiety, etc. This plan assumed exam after 6 months; if you\u2019re ahead of\nschedule and feel ready now, you could even take it earlier . If not, adjust plan to do more practice where\nneeded. The key is mastery and confidence.\nMotivation:  You are basically at the summit of CCNA preparation. The view is great \u2013 look back at all the\nconcepts you\u2019ve mastered! This week\u2019s intense review might be tiring, but think of it as polishing a gem:\nyou\u2019re  refining  rough  edges  so  you  can  shine  on  exam  day.  Keep  the  momentum  but  also  start\nenvisioning life post-exam (the next section will help with that \u2013 job prep, etc.). Remember , the goal is\nnot just to pass an exam, but to become a capable network engineer , and you\u2019re well on your way."

        "content": "Objectives (Week 13):\n- Begin a  capstone project : designing a small enterprise network from scratch, incorporating most\ntechnologies  learned.  This  week,  focus  on  planning  and  design  on  \u201cpaper\u201d  (or  software)  before\nimplementation next week.\n-  Scenario:  You are tasked to design a network for a small company with, say, 3 departments (like\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n71\n\u2022\n\u2022\n39\n\nAdmin, Engineering, Sales), two sites (HQ and Branch), and internet connectivity. They require: VLANs\nper  department,  inter-site  routing,  internet  access  for  all  via  HQ,  secure  remote  access  for  a  few\nemployees (VPN), and basic network security measures.\n- Create a  network diagram  of this topology: likely includes routers at each site, switches, maybe a\nfirewall (optional, or use router ACL as firewall), an ISP cloud, and maybe a server network.\n- Plan IP addressing: assign subnets to each VLAN and site, ensuring summarization if possible and\navoiding overlaps. Perhaps use private IPs internally and one public range for NAT at HQ.\n- Choose and justify routing: e.g., use OSPF between sites (maybe over a simulated WAN), static default\nto internet, etc. - Plan out where to apply security: e.g., port security on user ports, ACL on router to\nfilter internet traffic, VPN using perhaps Packet Tracer\u2019s VPN feature (if any, else just conceptual).\n- Essentially, write a network design document : including network requirements, IP scheme, device\nroles, protocols, and security measures.\n- Get feedback if possible: if you have a mentor or friend in networking, show them the design for\ncritique. If not, self-review by comparing to reference architectures from Cisco (e.g., Enterprise Network\nModel).\nResources:\n- Reference Designs:\n- Cisco Validated Designs or CCNA case studies. Perhaps Cisco Press CCNA books had a final chapter\nwith a case study network \u2013 use that as inspiration or reference.\n- The old \u201cHierarchical Network Model\u201d (Core/Dist/Access) \u2013 since we have HQ and Branch, maybe HQ\nhas a core switch and some access switches. Use two-tier design (collapsed core) given small size.\n- Subnet calculators  (to double-check your addressing plan efficiency).\n- Visio or draw.io stencils  \u2013 for making a nice diagram. (Or Packet Tracer\u2019s built-in drawing for a quick\nvisual).\nDesign considerations:\nVLAN for each department (plus maybe a management VLAN, and a VLAN for voice if any VoIP \u2013\noptional).\nRedundancy: maybe not a huge network, but could have two switches at HQ with EtherChannel\nand HSRP for gateway redundancy as a bonus. If it complicates, keep it smaller .\nBranch could be simpler (one router , one switch).\nWAN link: simulate maybe as a serial or just an IP cloud. If using PT, can connect routers via\ncloud or directly.\nSecurity: plan where to put an ACL (likely on HQ router outbound to internet to restrict certain\ntraffic, and inbound from internet to allow only VPN or necessary).\nVPN: If PT supports GRE or IPsec, perhaps plan an IPsec tunnel between HQ and Branch or for\nremote user \u2013 if not, just state it.\nAutomation: not required in design, but you can mention future plan to use Ansible for\nconsistency.\nMilestones & Checkpoints:\n- Milestone 1:  Complete a network diagram  of the proposed design, showing all subnets and VLAN\nIDs, device names, interfaces, and relevant IP addresses. This is the blueprint for your implementation.\n-  Milestone 2:  Write out the  IP addressing plan : e.g., \u201c192.168.10.0/24 \u2013 Admin VLAN 10 at HQ (50\nusers), 192.168.20.0/24 \u2013 Eng VLAN 20 at HQ (30 users), 192.168.30.0/24 \u2013 Sales VLAN 30 at HQ (20\nusers), 192.168.40.0/24 \u2013 Branch office LAN (30 users). WAN: 10.0.0.0/30 between HQ and Branch.\u201d\nEnsure the sizing fits (no VLAN has more IPs than needed but leave some growth).\n- Milestone 3:  Enumerate the technologies to use: \u201cOSPF area 0 between HQ and Branch routers; Inter-\nVLAN routing via multilayer switch at HQ or router-on-a-stick; PAT on HQ router for internet; Port\nsecurity on access ports (max 2 MAC for phones+PC maybe); DHCP from HQ server/router; ACL on HQ\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n40\n\nrouter to block certain ports (e.g., disallow telnet from outside); Site-to-site VPN planned (conceptual).\u201d\nThis list will guide config.\n-  Checkpoint:  Validate the plan against CCNA topics: did you include at least something from each\ndomain?  Likely  yes:  VLANs  (Network  Access),  OSPF  (IP  Connectivity),  NAT/DHCP  (IP  Services),  ACL/\nsecurity (Security Fundamentals), maybe mention of automation (like \u201cwe will use SSH and maybe\nnetwork scripts for config backup\u201d for Automation, albeit light). The aim is to demonstrate holistic\nunderstanding.\n- Next step will be implementing and testing this design in Week 14.\nMotivation:  Designing a network from scratch is the ultimate test of understanding \u2013 it forces you to\nconsider how pieces fit together . Don\u2019t worry if you have to adjust along the way (that\u2019s normal). Enjoy\nthis creative and analytical process \u2013 it resembles real job tasks. You\u2019re effectively acting as a network\nengineer/architect now, which is exactly the outcome we wanted. Take pride in that!"

        "title": "Capstone Network Implementation and Test",
        "content": "Objectives (Week 14):\n- Implement the designed network in Packet Tracer (or real gear if accessible) step-by-step.\n- Configure VLANs and trunking at HQ, set up inter-VLAN routing (either a layer 3 switch SVIs or a\nrouter-on-a-stick). Configure OSPF between HQ and Branch routers, ensure routes exchanged.\n- Set up DHCP server (maybe at HQ for all subnets, using DHCP relay to branch). Set up NAT on HQ for\ninternet access simulation (use a loopback or cloud as Internet).\n- Apply security: port security on switches, ACL on HQ router for traffic filtering, secure device configs\n(SSH login). If possible, configure an IPsec VPN between HQ and Branch (PT might have a \u201cVPN easy\u201d\noption on routers \u2013 if not, simulate by just allowing direct since it\u2019s lab).\n- Test end-to-end: from a PC in each VLAN, ping others, ping branch, ping internet (maybe simulate\ninternet as a server in a different network beyond HQ router). Test fail-safes if any (e.g., if you did HSRP\nwith two routers at HQ, shut one to see continuity).\n- Troubleshoot any issues encountered \u2013 this is likely. It\u2019s part of learning: maybe OSPF adjacency fails\ndue to passive interface or NAT issues. Work through them systematically (like you would on exam sims\nor real world).\n- Once stable, document the configuration : save config files, and perhaps write an executive summary\nof the network to accompany the diagram.\n- This project is also material you can mention in interviews or on a resume (it\u2019s home lab, but it shows\ninitiative and skills).\nResources:\n-  Packet Tracer : Use PT\u2019s multi-tab to keep track of different config sections (and it allows notes on\ntopology).\n- Prior labs : You basically will reuse many configurations from prior weeks but combined. Refer back if\nneeded (no shame in checking a command if memory is unsure \u2013 in real world you\u2019d check docs \u2013 but\ntry to recall first).\n- Peer review : if you know someone else in CCNA, maybe share your Packet Tracer file for them to test,\nand vice versa. Fresh eyes might catch config mistakes.\nMilestones & Checkpoints:\n- Milestone 1:  All critical configs done: VLANs, OSPF, NAT, DHCP, ACLs, port security. The network should\nbe functioning as intended. For example: Users get IP via DHCP, can reach resources in other VLANs and\nbranch, internet pings go out (maybe not real internet but a fake server), and disallowed traffic is\nindeed blocked by ACL.\n- Milestone 2:  Testing results documented. Make a table: each VLAN PC -> where should it reach and\n41\n\nnot reach? Test ping/HTTP etc. E.g., \u201cPC in Sales VLAN -> should reach Branch server (ping ok), should\nbrowse internet (http ok, tested by HTTP to fake server), should NOT telnet outside (tried telnet, blocked\nas expected by ACL).\u201d Do this for key scenarios. All tests should align with design goals.\n- Milestone 3:  Configuration review: run show run  on each device and ensure no glaring issues (e.g.,\ndefault  passwords,  missing  service  encryption,  etc.).  Also  note  resource  usage:  Did  you  use  small\nsubnets efficiently? Are there any routing table oddities? Clean up if necessary (like remove any test ACL\nlines, etc.).\n-  Milestone 4:  Save your final Packet Tracer file and also export configs (for your portfolio). Create a\nbrief  Network  Implementation  Report  with  the  diagram,  summary  of  addressing,  summary  of\nprotocols, and verification outputs (like OSPF neighbor table, NAT translation sample, etc.). Even if just\nfor yourself, this consolidates what you\u2019ve built.\n- Checkpoint:  Congratulate yourself \u2013 you\u2019ve essentially simulated the job of setting up an enterprise\nnetwork! This capstone ties together months of learning. It should boost your confidence that not only\ncan  you  answer  exam  questions,  you  can  actually  apply  the  knowledge.  This  is  the  bridge  from\ncertification to real-world skill. Use this accomplishment as a talking point in interviews and as personal\nvalidation of your abilities.\nMotivation:  Finishing a project like this is hugely satisfying. Think about how far you\u2019ve come \u2013 from not\nknowing what a VLAN or OSPF was, to now building a network with both. That\u2019s tangible progress. If\nparts  of  the  project  were  challenging,  that\u2019s  good  \u2013  better  to  face  challenges  in  practice  than  in\nproduction. Now, any remaining focus can shift fully to exam-day readiness and job prep, knowing that\nyour skill foundation is strong."

        "content": "Objectives (Week 15):\n-  Final exam prep : do a last round of practice exams or question banks focusing on weak areas\nidentified. If you have Boson Exam C or other sets, do them.\n- Review flashcards or notes for anything that still trips you up. At this stage, avoid overloading on new\ninfo; just solidify recall and understanding.\n- Go over  exam-day logistics : Ensure you know location if in-person, or setup if online (test your\nwebcam,  internet,  clear  workspace  if  doing  online  proctored).  Have  two  forms  of  ID  ready.  Read\nPearsonVue exam rules.\n- Prepare mentally: in the last 1-2 days before exam, shift to light review and adequate rest . You won\u2019t\ngain much new knowledge cramming last minute, but you could tire yourself. Better to be fresh.\n- Maybe skim through the official exam topics list one more time and say out loud or on paper the main\nconcept of each \u2013 if those come easily, you\u2019re set.\n- Plan to arrive early  if going to a center , or be set up early if online.\n- Have a strategy: e.g., initial 10 seconds brain-dump on scratch paper (some do this for subnet table or\nkey acronyms \u2013 though some test centers might not allow writing until exam starts, check rules).\n- Confidence: remind yourself of all the work put in. Some anxiety is normal, but trust your preparation.\nYou  have  consistently  scored  well  in  mocks  by  now  and  the  capstone  success  shows  deep\nunderstanding.\n- Exam Day:  Execute your plan calmly. Manage time \u2013 if a question is super confusing or long, mark and\nmove on, come back if time. Many find they have extra time at end because they practiced pacing. Use\nany leftover time to review flagged questions.\n- After submitting, breathe \u2013 you\u2019ll see the result on screen. We expect a PASS!  If for some reason not\n(stuff happens), analyze and you still have Month 6 to re-focus \u2013 but likely you got it.\n- Celebrate achievement \u2013 it\u2019s huge. Then short break and onward to job hunting prep.\n42\n\nResources:\n- Test-Day tips articles  \u2013 e.g., \u201cWhat to do on CCNA exam day\u201d blogs, often recommending good sleep,\nlight meal, etc.\n- Pearson Vue tutorial  \u2013 if you can find a preview of the exam interface (sometimes they have a generic\ntest tutorial), to know how sim questions look and how to answer drag-and-drop etc.\n-  Online communities  \u2013 some people post their exam experience (without violating NDA). It can be\nreassuring  to  read  a  few  \u201cI  passed  CCNA,  it  was  easier/harder  than  I  thought\u201d  just  to  calibrate\nexpectations, but don't let it spook you \u2013 everyone\u2019s experience varies.\n- Your support system  \u2013 whether friends or family, let them know you have the exam and maybe arrange\nsomething fun after as a reward.\nMilestones & Checkpoints:\n-  Milestone 1:  Achieve passing scores on final practice tests consistently (~85%+). If any domain still\nlingers in 60-70%, do targeted quick refresh (e.g., re-read that chapter summary or watch a short video)\nuntil you\u2019re confident.\n- Milestone 2:  Flashcards all green \u2013 by now, you might retire the deck, or just quickly flip through and\nrealize you know it all. If a few sticky points remain (like memorizing some numeric values or IEEE\nnumbers, etc.), decide if it\u2019s worth last-minute memorizing. CCNA is more about understanding than\nrote memorization (apart from subnetting maybe), so focus accordingly.\n-  Milestone 3: Exam completed with passing score.  You\u2019ll get a preliminary pass notification. Huge\nmoment! You can now proudly call yourself a Cisco Certified Network Associate. This is the culmination\nof the 5 months of hard work.\n-  Checkpoint:  With  the  exam  behind  you  (hopefully),  shift  mind  to  leveraging  this  cert:  updating\nresume, sharing the news on LinkedIn, and preparing for job interviews. The final month will focus on\nthat transition.\nMotivation:  This week is about keeping a cool head and trusting your journey. Confidence is earned, and\nyou\u2019ve earned it. Imagine walking out of the testing center with a grin, or seeing \u201cCongratulations!\u201d on\nthe screen. It\u2019s not luck \u2013 it\u2019s your dedication paying off. And remember , even beyond the exam, the\nknowledge stays with you. As the CCNA motto suggests, it\u2019s not just a test, it\u2019s training for your career .\nGo get that cert!"

Possibly add a lab section or\npersonal projects section, since as a beginner that shows initiative.\n- Create or update your LinkedIn : add CCNA cert (you can add via Cisco\u2019s Cert manager to verify). Write\na  bio  that  you  are  a  certified  network  engineer  excited  about  networking.  Connect  with  people\n(recruiters, network engineers, people from local Cisco user groups).\n- Clean up your online presence (if any professional footprint beyond LinkedIn) \u2013 ensure your LinkedIn\nphoto is professional, and no inappropriate public posts elsewhere that employers might see.\n-  Consider  creating  a  portfolio  site  or  GitHub:  maybe  upload  some  sanitized  lab  configs  or\ndocumentation, or a blog post about your study journey. This isn\u2019t required, but can set you apart if you\nenjoy writing or sharing knowledge.\n- Have someone review your resume (a mentor , friend in industry, or even use a free online resume\ncritique service if available).

E.g., \u201cBuilt a multi-site network in lab using OSPF and implemented\nnetwork security (ACLs, VPN)\u201d \u2013 this is from your capstone. Even if lab, it\u2019s relevant experience.\n- Milestone 2:  Update LinkedIn profile to \u201cOpen to work\u201d (if job hunting) and with CCNA credential. Post\nan update about achieving CCNA \u2013 often that can get attention from connections and maybe recruiters\n(plus congrats that make you visible).\n- Milestone 3:  Ensure other sections are good: short summary in resume emphasizing you are eager to\napply networking knowledge, education updated (if you did any courses, mention Networking Academy\ncourses or self-study).\n- Checkpoint:  You now have a professional presentation to the world as a network engineer .

        "title": "Common Interview Questions and Lab Drills",
        "content": "Objectives (Week 17):\n-  Prepare  for  technical  interview  questions :  these  could  be  theoretical  (\u201cExplain  OSPF  vs  RIP\u201d),\nscenario-based (\u201cIf a user can\u2019t reach Google, how do you troubleshoot?\u201d), or simple direct questions\n44\n\n(\u201cWhat is a VLAN? What is subnetting and why is it useful? Describe the TCP handshake.\u201d).\n- Compile a list of ~20 common networking interview questions (Google \u201cCCNA interview questions\u201d).\nWrite out or speak your answers, ensuring clarity and confidence.\n- Particularly focus on areas interviewers love: subnetting on the fly (they may ask you to calculate a\nsubnet or find a subnet ID quickly), troubleshooting approach, and basic definitions.\n- Practice behavioral questions  too (STAR method: Situation, Task, Action, Result): e.g., \u201cTell me about a\ntime you solved a difficult technical problem\u201d \u2013 you can use your labs or projects as examples (\u201cI was\nconfiguring  OSPF  and  neighbors  wouldn\u2019t  form;  I  systematically  checked  parameters,  found  a\nmismatch, resolved it \u2013 showing persistence and troubleshooting skills\u201d).\n- If possible, do a mock interview : have a friend pose as interviewer (preferably someone in IT) and run\nthrough questions. Or record yourself answering and critically review (are you concise? Too nervous?\nUsing filler words?).\n- Brush up on any tool or platform mentioned in job listings: e.g., some places might use Ticket systems\n(like  ServiceNow)  \u2013  be  ready  to  say  you  are  familiar  with  the  concept  of  ticketing;  mention\ndocumentation skills (like using Notion or wiki as you did for notes).\n- Revisit labs to ensure you can do simple tasks if asked on spot (some interviews might have a practical\ntest, like configuring a switch or writing an ACL). If you have access to Packet Tracer during an interview\nor whiteboard, practice explaining your steps as you would if they watch you configure.\nResources:\n- Interview question lists:  Many blogs and YouTube videos list top CCNA or network engineer interview\nquestions. E.g., \u201cWhat is the difference between a hub, switch, and router?\u201d, \u201cHow does traceroute\nwork?\u201d, \u201cWhat is ARP?\u201d, \u201cDescribe an IP routing process.\u201d\n- Glassdoor  \u2013 search for network engineer interviews at companies to see real questions they got.\n- Mock interview services  \u2013 if you want professional help, some platforms connect you with industry pros\nfor mock interviews (sometimes paid).\n- Friends or mentors  \u2013 if you know someone in networking, ask if they\u2019d quiz you. They might throw in\ncurveballs which is good practice.\n- Technical practice:  If expecting a technical test, review how to configure basics quickly. Possibly set a\ntimer for yourself to, say, assign IPs to interfaces and get OSPF running in 10 minutes. Speed isn\u2019t\nusually tested in interviews deeply, but you want to show you know your stuff without too much guess.\nMilestones:\n-  Milestone  1:  Create  an  Q&A  list  with  answers  you're  happy  with  for  at  least  20  likely  technical\nquestions. For example, Q: \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between TCP and UDP?\u201d \u2013 A: \u201cTCP is connection-\noriented, provides reliable delivery with acknowledgments and retransmission, used for things like web\nbrowsing; UDP is connectionless, no guarantee of delivery, used for streaming or DNS where speed is\nimportant.\u201d Practice saying it aloud smoothly.\n-  Milestone 2:  Successfully perform a mock troubleshooting scenario. E.g., friend says: \u201cUser can\u2019t\naccess email.\u201d You verbally walk through troubleshooting: \u201cFirst, I\u2019d ask if others are affected (scope).\nThen check connectivity: ping user\u2019s PC, gateway, etc. Check DNS if webmail. If network, could be an ACL\nor route issue\u2026\u201d \u2013 show logical approach. The goal is to demonstrate you have a structured method, not\nnecessarily solve an unknown issue in real-time (they want to see your thinking).\n- Milestone 3:  Identify any weak points that came up during practice. Perhaps you stumbled explaining\nSTP or forgot part of the OSI model. Quickly brush up on those now.\n- Checkpoint:  By now, answering typical interview questions should feel much easier than before your\nstudies.  You  can  talk  about  technologies  confidently  and  also  showcase  critical  thinking  in\ntroubleshooting. This is crucial for convincing employers. Next, we\u2019ll target job search and refining such\ncommunication further .\n45\n\nMotivation:  Remember , an interview is as much about demonstrating your enthusiasm and thought\nprocess  as it is about reciting facts. Given your preparation, you  know  the facts \u2013 now convey your\npassion for networking and your problem-solving skills. Every question is an opportunity to show you\u2019re\nnot just certified, but also a great colleague to work with (eager to learn, team-oriented, etc.). Practice\nuntil you feel positive and ready for real interviews!"

        "title": "Job Search and Applications Strategy",
        "content": "Objectives (Week 18):\n- Identify target roles: network engineer (entry-level), network administrator , NOC technician, IT support\nwith networking focus, etc., ideally that list CCNA or similar as requirement.\n- Use job boards (LinkedIn jobs, Indeed, Cisco\u2019s own, local companies\u2019 career pages) to find openings.\nAim to apply to multiple jobs per week \u2013 job hunting can be a numbers game.\n-  Customize  your  cover  letter  (if  requested)  for  each  job  \u2013  highlight  how  your  skills  match  their\nenvironment  (if  they  mention  Cisco  ASA,  say  you  have  strong  Cisco  knowledge  and  are  learning\nfirewalls, etc.). If no cover letter , your resume should have keywords matching their needs.\n- Use your network: reach out to any contacts in the industry. Let them know you\u2019re CCNA certified and\nlooking for roles. A referral can often get your resume seen.\n- Consider joining professional communities: e.g., Cisco Learning Network, local networkers meetup,\nmaybe user groups (even virtual). Sometimes job leads appear there.\n- Prepare to discuss salary: research typical entry-level network engineer salary in your region. Have a\nrange in mind (don\u2019t bring up unless asked, but be ready). With CCNA, you often have a bump over just\ngeneral IT tech.\n- Keep learning lightly: as you apply, perhaps peek at CCNP topics or SDN trends \u2013 not to dive deep but\nto show you\u2019re forward-thinking in interviews (\u201cI plan to pursue CCNP next\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m also exploring\nPython automation beyond CCNA\u201d). This demonstrates initiative.\n- Track your applications (perhaps in a spreadsheet or Trello) \u2013 company, role, date applied, status, so\nyou can follow up if needed and prepare for each interview specifically (research each company\u2019s\nnetwork or business, so you can tailor answers).\n- Don\u2019t get discouraged by rejections or silence; it\u2019s part of the process. Use any feedback to improve.\nCelebrate small wins (like an HR screening call) as progress.\nResources:\n- Job postings:  Look at the requirements and responsibilities \u2013 note common themes (like maybe many\nwant knowledge of OSPF, BGP (even if you only know basics of BGP), VLANs, etc.). Make sure those\nterms are on your resume if you have exposure (except don\u2019t lie if you truly never touched something).\n-  Cisco Networking Academy Alumni network  \u2013 sometimes NetAcad has partnerships or job boards for\nalumni; check that out.\n- Mentor advice:  If you have a mentor or someone who\u2019s a network engineer , ask them to refer you or\nguide you on entry points (e.g., maybe start at an ISP NOC which often hires CCNAs for network\nmonitoring \u2013 great learning environment).\n- Recruiters:  Talk to IT recruiters; some specialize in networking roles. They can also give resume tips or\nconnect you with contract positions to get experience.\nMilestones:\n-  Milestone  1:  Apply  to  at  least  X  jobs  this  week  (X  depends  on  availability,  maybe  5-10  quality\napplications). Ensure each application you send has a tailored resume (if needed) and you follow any\ninstructions (some have questionnaires \u2013 answer carefully).\n- Milestone 2:  Reach out to at least 3-5 professionals in networking \u2013 could be LinkedIn messages (e.g.,\n\u201cHi, I just got my CCNA and am looking for entry opportunities; I admire your career path, any advice\nyou might share would be greatly appreciated.\u201d \u2013 some might not reply, but some will and could offer\n46\n\nhelp). Also, don't hesitate to let friends know; sometimes opportunities come from casual connections.\n-  Milestone  3:  Prepare  a  quick  \u201celevator  pitch\u201d  for  networking  events  or  introductions:  \u201cI  recently\nbecame  CCNA-certified  and  built  extensive  home  lab  projects;  I\u2019m  excited  to  start  a  career  in\nnetworking,  particularly  in  network  support  or  junior  admin  roles  where  I  can  further  grow  and\ncontribute to a team.\u201d This helps when speaking to recruiters or at job fairs.\n- Checkpoint:  The job search might take weeks or a few months, but you\u2019ve set it in motion. Keep up\nmomentum and while waiting for responses, continue light study or labbing to keep skills fresh (and\nreduce anxiety). Now, final week ahead, we\u2019ll refine any last interview issues and plan continuous\ndevelopment.\nMotivation:  Job hunting can be a job in itself \u2013 treat it like part of your study plan. You are selling a\nproduct (your skills) that are genuinely valuable. Each \u201cno\u201d gets you closer to a \u201cyes\u201d statistically, and you\nonly  need  one  yes.  Remember  your  worth  with  CCNA  +  your  dedication  \u2013  not  everyone  has  the\npersistence to do what you did. Use that confidence when reaching out and interviewing. You are not\nbegging for a job; you are offering to help employers with your fresh skills and enthusiasm. That\npositive, proactive mindset will shine through."

        "number": 19,
        "title": "Interview Refinement and Continuous Learning",
        "content": "Objectives (Week 19):\n- By now you may start getting interview calls. This week, focus on any  specific feedback or upcoming\ninterviews . E.g., if you have an interview scheduled with a company that uses Cisco Meraki, read a bit\nabout Meraki dashboard so you can mention it. If one interview revealed a gap (say you got stumped by\na BGP question), do a quick study on BGP basics so you\u2019re better prepared next time.\n- Continue refining soft skills: practice speaking clearly about your experiences, maybe refine a story of\nhow you tackled a learning challenge (e.g., your six-month study journey itself is a great story to show\ndetermination and how you handle a long-term project).\n-  Network  further:  maybe  attend  a  local  networking  meetup  or  an  online  webinar  Cisco  hosts.\nSometimes you can mention these in interviews (\u201cRecently I joined a Cisco webinar on SD-WAN, I\u2019m\nreally interested in how that\u2019s shaping networks\u201d \u2013 shows interest beyond just what you had to study).\n- Plan for  continued learning : Many interviewers ask \u201cWhat are your future plans?\u201c. State that you\nintend to keep advancing \u2013 maybe plan CCNP Enterprise or DevNet Associate next, or that you\u2019re\ncurious about cloud networking (if that\u2019s true). This signals you\u2019ll grow with the role.\n- If job offer comes in (woohoo!), analyze it: consider role duties and growth opportunity, not just salary.\nAs an entry-level, you want a place where you can learn from senior engineers and get hands-on. If\nmultiple offers, weigh pros/cons (maybe consult your mentor).\n- Even after landing a job, schedule time for continuous improvement. But for now, let\u2019s focus on acing\nany final interviews.\nResources:\n-  Advanced topics glimpses:  If applying to places with more advanced tech (like BGP, NAT64, wireless\ncontrollers), you may not know deeply but a Cisco Live presentation or NetworkChuck video on that\ntopic can give you talking points.\n- Community help:  The Cisco Learning Network forums have career sections \u2013 you can ask for advice or\nread others\u2019 stories of getting first job.\n- Etiquette:  If you get offers or rejections, know how to professionally handle them (e.g., thank them for\nconsideration even if rejected \u2013 sometimes they keep you in mind for future if you\u2019re gracious).\n- Personal development:  Maybe pick up a book on professional soft skills or time management \u2013 this can\nindirectly improve your workplace readiness.\n47\n\nMilestones:\n-  Milestone 1:  Evaluate how interviews are going. If you\u2019ve done a few, what pattern of questions\nemerges? Are there any you consistently struggle with? Focus on those now intensely. Perhaps mock\nanswer in front of a mirror until it\u2019s smooth.\n-  Milestone 2:  If you have an upcoming technical assessment or second-round interview, prepare\nspecifically: e.g., review that company\u2019s tech stack (maybe gleaned from job description) and be ready to\ndiscuss those topics. Also have some intelligent questions to ask them (like \u201cI saw you use EIGRP \u2013 are\nyou planning any migration to OSPF or BGP? What\u2019s the team\u2019s approach to new technologies?\u201d \u2013 shows\nyou care and think ahead).\n- Milestone 3:  Keep applying if needed. Aim to fill your pipeline \u2013 interviews often come in waves. The\nmore you do, the more confident you become.\n- Checkpoint:  By end of Month 6, ideally you have landed a job or are in late stages. If not, don\u2019t despair\n\u2013 sometimes it takes longer . Keep up applications and maybe seek feedback from each interview to\nimprove. Use the CCNA community for support. The key is not to stagnate: while searching, maybe start\non CCNP ENCOR study or labs to stay sharp and become even more qualified. That could be integrated\nas next steps (though beyond this plan\u2019s scope).\nMotivation:  You've transformed from a beginner to a certified professional with a plan. That\u2019s huge! Now\nthe challenge is to get someone to give you that break \u2013 and they will, because your preparation shows.\nStay persistent and maintain the learning mindset. The end of this 6-month plan is really the beginning\nof your career journey. The habits you built \u2013 regular study, lab practice, note-taking \u2013 will serve you well\non the job and for future certs. Be proud of how far you\u2019ve come, and get excited for what\u2019s ahead. You\ngot this!\nCCNA 200-301 Exam Blueprint Topics Reference\n(For quick lookup, all official exam topics are listed below \u2013 ensure you've covered each in the study plan\nabove.)\n1.0  Network  Fundamentals:  Network  components  (Routers,  Switches,  Firewalls,  APs,\nControllers, Endpoints, Servers, PoE) ;
