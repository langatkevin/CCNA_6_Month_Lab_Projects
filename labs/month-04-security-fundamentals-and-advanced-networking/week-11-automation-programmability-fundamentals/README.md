# Week 11 - Automation & Programmability Fundamentals

> Adapted from the "6-Month CCNA 200-301 Study Plan" reference.

## Objectives
- Review automation basics: REST concepts, JSON, and YANG at a high level.
- Use Python or another tool to send simple CLI batches to devices.
- Experiment with Packet Tracer APIs or textFSM-style parsing.
- Track repetitive tasks that could be automated later.

## Hands-On Labs & Mini Projects
- Lab 11.1 - Write a small script that logs into a device and runs show commands.
- Lab 11.2 - Parse command output and save structured data to a file.
- Planning task - List top manual workflows that automation could improve.

## Milestones & Checkpoints
- Repository or folder created for automation snippets.
- Sample script committed with comments on prerequisites.
- Backlog of automation ideas prioritized by impact.
