# Week 12 - Comprehensive Review and Mock Exam

> Adapted from the "6-Month CCNA 200-301 Study Plan" reference.

## Objectives
- Systematic review of all domains: Each day of this week, focus on one domain's key points and "must- know" facts/configs. E.g., Day1: Network Fundamentals recap, Day2: Network Access recap, etc. Use your notes, flashcards, and maybe re-watch 2x speed videos or skim chapters to reinforce.
- Identify and fill any remaining gaps: If certain labs were skipped or still shaky (maybe IPv6 or OSPF area type details), address them now with quick labs or reading.
- Take at least one more full-length mock exam (preferably a different set of questions than week 11's).
- Aim to exceed the passing score margin (target ~90% so you have cushion).
- Practice Simulations and practical scenarios : If you have access to simulation-style questions (like configuring something under time), practice a couple. If not, create your own mini-scenarios to configure without looking at guides (like: "Configure OSPF on these routers, with passive interface on
- LAN, and default route advertisement - go!" and see if you can do it quickly).
- Refine test-taking strategies: manage time (approx 1 min/question, more for sim), flag tough110 65 37 questions and move on, eliminate wrong answers in MCQs by logic, etc. Train your brain to stay calm and methodical during the exam.
- Ensure you are ready with practical skills as well: though CCNA is theory + some sim, for job readiness, ensure you can do the common tasks without peeking at notes now.
- By end of week, be exam-ready and also ready to apply knowledge in a capstone project next month.

## Hands-On Labs & Mini Projects
- Lab practice: Quickly lab any config that you don't feel second-nature: e.g., "Setting up trunk + EtherChannel" quickly, or "One static NAT and one PAT" quickly. This just builds muscle memory and confidence. If possible, do a timed lab: e.g., give yourself 30 minutes to configure a small network from scratch (3 routers OSPF + 2 VLANs + NAT, etc.). This isn't for exam (they won't be that extensive due to time), but for you to consolidate integration of topics. Ensure you know how to verify and troubleshoot in labs swiftly: e.g., commands like ping, traceroute , show ip int brief , show cdp neighbors , etc., should come to mind easily to diagnose things, because some exam sims might require troubleshooting a misconfig. Flashcards: By now you have many flashcards - keep reviewing daily, but also start trimming ones you always get right (or mark them as known). Focus on ones you still slip on. 38 The day before exam (in plan, that's next month), you might just skim through all to ensure nothing forgotten. Health/Mental Prep: This is part of review week too: Plan your exam logistics (if you intend to take it right after Month 5, schedule it now so you have a date !). Having it scheduled will drive you. Ensure you get good rest and not burn out this week - if you study too hard without breaks, retention drops. Take short breaks, stay hydrated, exercise a bit. Practice some mindfulness or positive visualization: imagine opening your exam result with a pass - that's motivating and calms nerves.

## Milestones & Checkpoints
- Milestone 1: Score well on Mock Exam(s). For instance, if Boson exam gives scores per section, ensure none of the six domains is below ~80%. If one is, revisit that domain's content until you can raise it.
- Milestone 2: Conduct a thorough self-assessment : Print out (or write down) each exam blueprint topic and rate your confidence 1-5. For any 3 or below, do a targeted review. After review, all should be 4 or 5 (meaning "I could answer an exam question or do a basic lab on this").
- Milestone 3: Complete a final lab or troubleshoot challenge without hints, successfully. For example, purposely break something in a network (like an OSPF area mismatch or an ACL blocking a service) and see if you can find and fix it quickly. This shows you can apply knowledge dynamically, which is great for job skills.
- Milestone 4: Organize your study materials for next month's capstone and job prep: e.g., have your best notes and diagrams ready to refer to when designing the final project and for interview prep (it's handy to show or at least talk about a project with documentation).
- Checkpoint: You should now feel ready to schedule or soon take the CCNA exam . If not, identify what's holding you back - content, test anxiety, etc. This plan assumed exam after 6 months; if you're ahead of schedule and feel ready now, you could even take it earlier . If not, adjust plan to do more practice where needed. The key is mastery and confidence.
