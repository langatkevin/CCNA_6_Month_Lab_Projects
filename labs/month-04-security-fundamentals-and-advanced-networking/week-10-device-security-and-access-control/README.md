# Week 10 - Device Security and Access Control

> Adapted from the "6-Month CCNA 200-301 Study Plan" reference.

## Objectives
- Harden device access (secure console, VTY, and enable secrets).
- Apply AAA concepts such as local users and role separation.
- Practice Layer 2 security features: port security, DHCP snooping, DAI.
- Draft a baseline security checklist for lab gear.

## Hands-On Labs & Mini Projects
- Lab 10.1 - Secure console/VTY access and enable SSH-only management.
- Lab 10.2 - Configure port security and DHCP snooping on access switches.
- Checklist - Document every security control applied in the lab.

## Milestones & Checkpoints
- Security baseline template completed for future use.
- Lab evidence showing blocked violations or snooping activity.
- Reflection on remaining security gaps to tackle next.
