# Month 04 - Security Fundamentals and Advanced Networking

**Focus:** Month 4 addresses the Security Fundamentals (15%) domain and ties up any leftover core topics. We will cover device security (passwords, AAA concepts), Layer 2 security (like port security, DHCP snooping) and wireless security. We'll also introduce some automation basics (to prep for Month 5) and do heavy review this month - mock tests and revisiting weak spots. By the end of Month 4, you should have touched all exam topics at least once. Domains covered: Security Fundamentals (CCNA 5.0) and parts of Automation/Programmability (basic intro). Plus ongoing review of earlier domains.
