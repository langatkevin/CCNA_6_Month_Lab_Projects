# Week 17 - Common Interview Questions and Lab Drills

> Adapted from the "6-Month CCNA 200-301 Study Plan" reference.

## Objectives
- Prepare for technical interview questions : these could be theoretical ("Explain OSPF vs RIP"), scenario-based ("If a user can't reach Google, how do you troubleshoot?"), or simple direct questions 44 ("What is a VLAN? What is subnetting and why is it useful? Describe the TCP handshake.").
- Compile a list of ~20 common networking interview questions (Google "CCNA interview questions").
- Write out or speak your answers, ensuring clarity and confidence.
- Particularly focus on areas interviewers love: subnetting on the fly (they may ask you to calculate a subnet or find a subnet ID quickly), troubleshooting approach, and basic definitions.
- Practice behavioral questions too (STAR method: Situation, Task, Action, Result): e.g., "Tell me about a time you solved a difficult technical problem" - you can use your labs or projects as examples ("I was configuring OSPF and neighbors wouldn't form; I systematically checked parameters, found a mismatch, resolved it - showing persistence and troubleshooting skills").
- If possible, do a mock interview : have a friend pose as interviewer (preferably someone in IT) and run through questions. Or record yourself answering and critically review (are you concise? Too nervous?
- Using filler words?).
- Brush up on any tool or platform mentioned in job listings: e.g., some places might use Ticket systems (like ServiceNow) - be ready to say you are familiar with the concept of ticketing; mention documentation skills (like using Notion or wiki as you did for notes).
- Revisit labs to ensure you can do simple tasks if asked on spot (some interviews might have a practical test, like configuring a switch or writing an ACL). If you have access to Packet Tracer during an interview or whiteboard, practice explaining your steps as you would if they watch you configure.

## Hands-On Labs & Mini Projects
- Add your own items from the study plan.

## Milestones & Checkpoints
- Milestones:
- Milestone 1: Create an Q&A list with answers you're happy with for at least 20 likely technical questions. For example, Q: "What's the difference between TCP and UDP?" - A: "TCP is connection- oriented, provides reliable delivery with acknowledgments and retransmission, used for things like web browsing; UDP is connectionless, no guarantee of delivery, used for streaming or DNS where speed is important." Practice saying it aloud smoothly.
- Milestone 2: Successfully perform a mock troubleshooting scenario. E.g., friend says: "User can't access email." You verbally walk through troubleshooting: "First, I'd ask if others are affected (scope). Then check connectivity: ping user's PC, gateway, etc. Check DNS if webmail. If network, could be an ACL or route issue..." - show logical approach. The goal is to demonstrate you have a structured method, not necessarily solve an unknown issue in real-time (they want to see your thinking).
- Milestone 3: Identify any weak points that came up during practice. Perhaps you stumbled explaining STP or forgot part of the OSI model. Quickly brush up on those now.
- Checkpoint: By now, answering typical interview questions should feel much easier than before your studies. You can talk about technologies confidently and also showcase critical thinking in troubleshooting. This is crucial for convincing employers. Next, we'll target job search and refining such communication further . 45
