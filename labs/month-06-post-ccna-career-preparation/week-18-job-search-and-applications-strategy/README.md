# Week 18 - Job Search and Applications Strategy

> Adapted from the "6-Month CCNA 200-301 Study Plan" reference.

## Objectives
- Identify target roles: network engineer (entry-level), network administrator , NOC technician, IT support with networking focus, etc., ideally that list CCNA or similar as requirement.
- Use job boards (LinkedIn jobs, Indeed, Cisco's own, local companies' career pages) to find openings.
- Aim to apply to multiple jobs per week - job hunting can be a numbers game.
- Customize your cover letter (if requested) for each job - highlight how your skills match their environment (if they mention Cisco ASA, say you have strong Cisco knowledge and are learning firewalls, etc.). If no cover letter , your resume should have keywords matching their needs.
- Use your network: reach out to any contacts in the industry. Let them know you're CCNA certified and looking for roles. A referral can often get your resume seen.
- Consider joining professional communities: e.g., Cisco Learning Network, local networkers meetup, maybe user groups (even virtual). Sometimes job leads appear there.
- Prepare to discuss salary: research typical entry-level network engineer salary in your region. Have a range in mind (don't bring up unless asked, but be ready). With CCNA, you often have a bump over just general IT tech.
- Keep learning lightly: as you apply, perhaps peek at CCNP topics or SDN trends - not to dive deep but to show you're forward-thinking in interviews ("I plan to pursue CCNP next" or "I'm also exploring
- Python automation beyond CCNA"). This demonstrates initiative.
- Track your applications (perhaps in a spreadsheet or Trello) - company, role, date applied, status, so you can follow up if needed and prepare for each interview specifically (research each company's network or business, so you can tailor answers).
- Don't get discouraged by rejections or silence; it's part of the process. Use any feedback to improve.
- Celebrate small wins (like an HR screening call) as progress.

## Hands-On Labs & Mini Projects
- Add your own items from the study plan.

## Milestones & Checkpoints
- Milestones:
- Milestone 1: Apply to at least X jobs this week (X depends on availability, maybe 5-10 quality applications). Ensure each application you send has a tailored resume (if needed) and you follow any instructions (some have questionnaires - answer carefully).
- Milestone 2: Reach out to at least 3-5 professionals in networking - could be LinkedIn messages (e.g., "Hi, I just got my CCNA and am looking for entry opportunities; I admire your career path, any advice you might share would be greatly appreciated." - some might not reply, but some will and could offer 46 help). Also, don't hesitate to let friends know; sometimes opportunities come from casual connections.
- Milestone 3: Prepare a quick "elevator pitch" for networking events or introductions: "I recently became CCNA-certified and built extensive home lab projects; I'm excited to start a career in networking, particularly in network support or junior admin roles where I can further grow and contribute to a team." This helps when speaking to recruiters or at job fairs.
- Checkpoint: The job search might take weeks or a few months, but you've set it in motion. Keep up momentum and while waiting for responses, continue light study or labbing to keep skills fresh (and reduce anxiety). Now, final week ahead, we'll refine any last interview issues and plan continuous development.
