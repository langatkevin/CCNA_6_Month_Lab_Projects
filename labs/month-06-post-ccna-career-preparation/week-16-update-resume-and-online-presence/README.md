# Week 16 - Update Resume and Online Presence

> Adapted from the "6-Month CCNA 200-301 Study Plan" reference.

## Objectives
- Update your resume/CV : Highlight the CCNA certification (and mention knowledge of specific skills from it). Also add any hands-on projects (like the capstone you did, home lab setups). Emphasize practical skills: e.g., "Configured and managed VLANs, OSPF routing, and ACLs in lab environments." 43
- If you have prior IT experience (even in helpdesk), tailor it to show networking exposure or relevant problem-solving.
- Keep resume concise (1-2 pages), focus on skills and achievements. Possibly add a lab section or personal projects section, since as a beginner that shows initiative.
- Create or update your LinkedIn : add CCNA cert (you can add via Cisco's Cert manager to verify). Write a bio that you are a certified network engineer excited about networking. Connect with people (recruiters, network engineers, people from local Cisco user groups).
- Clean up your online presence (if any professional footprint beyond LinkedIn) - ensure your LinkedIn photo is professional, and no inappropriate public posts elsewhere that employers might see.
- Consider creating a portfolio site or GitHub: maybe upload some sanitized lab configs or documentation, or a blog post about your study journey. This isn't required, but can set you apart if you enjoy writing or sharing knowledge.
- Have someone review your resume (a mentor , friend in industry, or even use a free online resume critique service if available). Feedback ensures it's clear and impactful.

## Hands-On Labs & Mini Projects
- Add your own items from the study plan.

## Milestones & Checkpoints
- Milestones:
- Milestone 1: Finalize resume with CCNA included and at least one project/experience bullet demonstrating networking skills. E.g., "Built a multi-site network in lab using OSPF and implemented network security (ACLs, VPN)" - this is from your capstone. Even if lab, it's relevant experience.
- Milestone 2: Update LinkedIn profile to "Open to work" (if job hunting) and with CCNA credential. Post an update about achieving CCNA - often that can get attention from connections and maybe recruiters (plus congrats that make you visible).
- Milestone 3: Ensure other sections are good: short summary in resume emphasizing you are eager to apply networking knowledge, education updated (if you did any courses, mention Networking Academy courses or self-study).
- Checkpoint: You now have a professional presentation to the world as a network engineer . Next, we'll focus on preparing to deliver in interviews and assessments.
