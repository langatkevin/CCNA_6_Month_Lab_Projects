# Week 15 - Final CCNA Exam Preparation and Rest

> Adapted from the "6-Month CCNA 200-301 Study Plan" reference.

## Objectives
- Final exam prep : do a last round of practice exams or question banks focusing on weak areas identified. If you have Boson Exam C or other sets, do them.
- Review flashcards or notes for anything that still trips you up. At this stage, avoid overloading on new info; just solidify recall and understanding.
- Go over exam-day logistics : Ensure you know location if in-person, or setup if online (test your webcam, internet, clear workspace if doing online proctored). Have two forms of ID ready. Read
- PearsonVue exam rules.
- Prepare mentally: in the last 1-2 days before exam, shift to light review and adequate rest . You won't gain much new knowledge cramming last minute, but you could tire yourself. Better to be fresh.
- Maybe skim through the official exam topics list one more time and say out loud or on paper the main concept of each - if those come easily, you're set.
- Plan to arrive early if going to a center , or be set up early if online.
- Have a strategy: e.g., initial 10 seconds brain-dump on scratch paper (some do this for subnet table or key acronyms - though some test centers might not allow writing until exam starts, check rules).
- Confidence: remind yourself of all the work put in. Some anxiety is normal, but trust your preparation.
- You have consistently scored well in mocks by now and the capstone success shows deep understanding.
- Exam Day: Execute your plan calmly. Manage time - if a question is super confusing or long, mark and move on, come back if time. Many find they have extra time at end because they practiced pacing. Use any leftover time to review flagged questions.
- After submitting, breathe - you'll see the result on screen. We expect a PASS! If for some reason not (stuff happens), analyze and you still have Month 6 to re-focus - but likely you got it.
- Celebrate achievement - it's huge. Then short break and onward to job hunting prep. 42

## Hands-On Labs & Mini Projects
- Add your own items from the study plan.

## Milestones & Checkpoints
- Milestone 1: Achieve passing scores on final practice tests consistently (~85%+). If any domain still lingers in 60-70%, do targeted quick refresh (e.g., re-read that chapter summary or watch a short video) until you're confident.
- Milestone 2: Flashcards all green - by now, you might retire the deck, or just quickly flip through and realize you know it all. If a few sticky points remain (like memorizing some numeric values or IEEE numbers, etc.), decide if it's worth last-minute memorizing. CCNA is more about understanding than rote memorization (apart from subnetting maybe), so focus accordingly.
- Milestone 3: Exam completed with passing score. You'll get a preliminary pass notification. Huge moment! You can now proudly call yourself a Cisco Certified Network Associate. This is the culmination of the 5 months of hard work.
- Checkpoint: With the exam behind you (hopefully), shift mind to leveraging this cert: updating resume, sharing the news on LinkedIn, and preparing for job interviews. The final month will focus on that transition.
