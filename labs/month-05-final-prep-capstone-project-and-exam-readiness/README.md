# Month 05 - Final Prep, Capstone Project, and Exam Readiness

**Focus:** Month 5 is about consolidation and application . We will integrate everything in a realistic capstone project , do last-mile prep with mock exams and flashcards, and finally take (and pass!) the CCNA exam likely in Week 4 or end of this month. Post-exam, we'll transition to job preparation tasks. (If you plan to take the exam in Month 6 instead, you can adjust accordingly, but this plan assumes by end of Month 5 you attempt the exam).
