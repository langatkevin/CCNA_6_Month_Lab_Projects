# Week 08 - OSPF - Single-Area Configuration and Theory

> Adapted from the "6-Month CCNA 200-301 Study Plan" reference.

## Objectives
- Review OSPF concepts: LSAs, DR/BDR, metrics, and areas.
- Configure single-area OSPF on routers and switches with routed ports.
- Verify adjacency states and SPF results with show commands.
- Experiment with interface cost changes to influence path selection.

## Hands-On Labs & Mini Projects
- Lab 8.1 - Build a three-router single-area OSPF topology.
- Lab 8.2 - Adjust interface costs and observe route changes.
- Packet capture - Inspect Hello packets to confirm neighbor settings.

## Milestones & Checkpoints
- Adjacency table recorded for every router in the lab.
- Cost-change experiment documented with before/after routing tables.
- Reflection paragraph summarizing OSPF lessons learned.
