# Week 08 - OSPF - Single-Area Configuration and Theory

> Adapted from the "6-Month CCNA 200-301 Study Plan" reference.

## Objectives
- Learn what OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is and why dynamic routing protocols are needed.
- Understand OSPF's general characteristics: link-state protocol, uses Dijkstra's algorithm, forms adjacencies with neighbors, floods LSAs.
- Know OSPF terminology: Router ID , Area (focus on single-area OSPF, typically Area 0 only in CCNA scope), DR/BDR on multiaccess networks like Ethernet , metric (cost, based on bandwidth).
- Configure single-area OSPFv2 on Cisco routers : using router ospf <process-id> and network statements, or interface ip ospf method. Practice a basic OSPF setup on a multi-router topology and verify adjacency formation ( show ip ospf neighbor ) and routes ( show ip route showing OSPF routes).
- Handle OSPF attributes: set the Router ID manually (and know auto-selection rules), observe that OSPF chooses a DR/BDR on broadcast networks (maybe simulate with 3 routers in one LAN).
- Basic OSPF troubleshooting: e.g., mismatched subnet masks or areas causing no adjacency.
- Cover OSPF for IPv6 (OSPFv3) conceptually - CCNA may not heavily test it, but know that OSPFv3 exists and is similar but separate process for IPv6. If time, configure one OSPFv3 instance for practice.
- Emphasize that OSPF is a key CCNA topic - possibly multiple exam questions, so spend ample time to master fundamentals.

## Hands-On Labs & Mini Projects
- Lab 8.1: OSPF Basic Configuration - Use a 3 or 4-router topology (could reuse static routing lab but remove static routes). Configure OSPF on all routers in Area 0. You can use the network commands (e.g., network 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.255 area 0 to cover certain ranges, or identify each interface). Ensure all routers become neighbors (use show ip ospf neighbor ). Assign a Loopback interface on one router to observe how OSPF advertises it (it should appear as O IA or O route in others if not area 0? Actually in single area it's just O). Expected Outcome: All routers have routes to all networks via OSPF in their routing tables. Test connectivity across the network.
- Lab 8.2: OSPF Router ID and Neighbor Relationships - In the above lab, set router IDs manually ( router-id X.X.X.X ) that are easy to identify (e.g., 1.1.1.1 for R1, etc.). Reload OSPF (clear process) so they take effect. Observe neighbor outputs listing these IDs. Then simulate a multiaccess segment: e.g., connect 3 routers to a single switch (or multi-point cloud) to simulate them on the same Ethernet. See in show ip ospf neighbor which one is DR, BDR, DROTHER - by default highest router ID becomes DR. Try changing OSPF priority on one router to make it DR. Expected Outcome: Understanding of DR/BDR election - only DR and BDR 24 show full adjacency with all, others (DROTHER) have 2-way with each other but full only with DR/ BDR. For CCNA, just know conceptually, but seeing it is nice.
- Lab 8.3: OSPF Passive Interface and Default Route - Take one of your routers (like an edge router) and configure a default route (maybe to a fake internet cloud or a stub network) and inject it into OSPF (using default-information originate ). Make some interface passive (like LAN interfaces that shouldn't form OSPF neighbor). Ensure OSPF still advertises the connected networks but doesn't try to neighbor on passive interfaces. Expected Outcome: Your internal routers receive a default route from OSPF (marked as O*E2 usually), and you understand passive-interface usage (security and efficiency to not send hellos on e.g. user LANs).
- Lab 8.4: OSPFv3 for IPv6 (optional) - If eager , configure OSPF for IPv6 on a dual-stack network. Even if just between two routers. This uses ipv6 ospf commands on interfaces and router ospf <id> ipv6 . Verify with show ipv6 ospf . Not heavily needed for CCNA, but one lab helps reinforce OSPF knowledge and demystifies IPv6 routing. (Project) OSPF Study Notes - Create a one-page "OSPF cheatsheet" in your own words: including OSPF message types (Hello, LSU, LSA concepts), neighbor requirements, OSPF metrics and default reference bandwidth, and common show commands and their meaning. This act of summarizing will prepare you for any exam question on OSPF as you'll have organized the info yourself.

## Milestones & Checkpoints
- Milestone 1: Configure a multi-router OSPF network and achieve full connectivity without any static 25 routes. Provide evidence: e.g., ping from one end to the other and the routing table from a router showing OSPF-learned routes. If you trust OSPF's routes and they match expectations (correct subnets and next hops), you did it right.
- Milestone 2: Demonstrate understanding of OSPF neighbor relationships. For instance, intentionally misconfigure a parameter (like area) to see adjacency fail, then correct it. Or identify in a multiaccess network which router became DR and why. Jot down a brief explanation of OSPF neighbor states and roles in your notes (even if CCNA doesn't test state names deeply, the process of explaining helps).
- Milestone 3: Score at least ~75-80% on OSPF quizzes. OSPF has nuance, so if you miss some, focus on those topics again. Key point: You should be comfortable with reading an OSPF config and understanding what each part does (network statements, router-id, etc.), and interpreting show ip ospf neighbor/route outputs. If any output line confuses you, clarify it now (like OSPF route codes: O = intra-area, O IA = interarea, E1/E2 = external - CCNA mostly single area so probably O routes only).
- Checkpoint: With OSPF covered, you have tackled the most complex part of CCNA routing. Ensure you also recall earlier routing topics: difference between OSPF and RIP/EIGRP (just basics: OSPF link-state vs RIP distance-vector), but note EIGRP is not in CCNA anymore aside from a mention. Double-check IP Connectivity blueprint: we've done static, OSPF, FHRP. The blueprint also lists understanding routing table components and forwarding decision process , which we've done. Also, first-hop redundancy (done conceptually). At this stage, you can route within and between networks pretty proficiently! Month 3 is not over - we'll now apply this in context of IP services.
