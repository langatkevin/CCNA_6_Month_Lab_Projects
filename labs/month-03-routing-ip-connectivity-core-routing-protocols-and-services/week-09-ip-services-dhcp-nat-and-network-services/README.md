# Week 09 - IP Services - DHCP , NAT, and Network Services

> Adapted from the "6-Month CCNA 200-301 Study Plan" reference.

## Objectives
- Configure DHCP pools, reservations, and relay agents.
- Practice PAT and static NAT for inside networks.
- Review supporting services such as DNS, NTP, and Syslog.
- Collect command outputs that prove each service is operating.

## Hands-On Labs & Mini Projects
- Lab 9.1 - Build a DHCP server and relay setup in Packet Tracer.
- Lab 9.2 - Configure PAT plus one static NAT rule and test translations.
- Service log - Enable Syslog or NTP and capture relevant output.

## Milestones & Checkpoints
- Address assignment table captured from the DHCP lab.
- NAT translation table annotated with each test case.
- Service verification commands stored for study notes.
