# Week 09 - IP Services - DHCP , NAT, and Network Services

> Adapted from the "6-Month CCNA 200-301 Study Plan" reference.

## Objectives
- Understand and configure DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) on Cisco devices : both
- DHCP server (on a router or multilayer switch) and DHCP relay (IP Helper). Know the DHCP process (DORA: Discover , Offer , Request, Ack) and what information is provided (IP, subnet mask, gateway, DNS, etc.).
- Set up NAT (Network Address Translation) on a router for IPv4: specifically PAT (Port Address
- Translation) for allowing multiple internal hosts to share one public IP (this is the typical use case). Also know static NAT (one-to-one) usage and configuration. CCNA expects you to configure and verify NAT in
- IOS.
- Learn about NTP (Network Time Protocol) and configure a router or switch to use NTP client mode (sync with a server) and potentially act as NTP server for others. Understand the importance of time sync in networks (for logging, certificates, etc.).
- Cover SNMP and Syslog concepts - possibly configuration basics: setting up a SNMP community on a router , and logging to a syslog server . We might not do deep labs on these, but at least know how to verify and the purpose (monitoring, network operations).
- Introduce QoS basics (Quality of Service): know what QoS is for - to prioritize certain traffic.
- Specifically, CCNA might mention classification and marking (DSCP values) and queueing strategies - just theoretical understanding. Possibly see how a router shows QoS config, but configuration likely not required.
- Summarize IP Services domain topics and ensure each is touched: DNS (role in network - not config on router , but know it translates names and often there's a "ip name-server" command to allow router to resolve names), FTP/TFTP uses (for file transfer e.g., router IOS upgrade via TFTP) , and SSH configuration on Cisco devices (we did some in earlier labs implicitly, but ensure you can configure a router/switch for SSH access).

## Hands-On Labs & Mini Projects
- Lab Manual / 31 Days - likely has a day for NAT and one for DHCP. Go through those for more practice questions. Cisco Press articles - often there are short guides like "NAT Fundamentals" on Cisco website. Use if you need alternate explanation, especially the NAT address terminology. Research Papers/Articles: RFC 2131 - DHCP protocol (just read a bit of intro if curious; know it's UDP 67/68 for exam possibly). Cisco Docs: "Configuring Network Address Translation" - covers IOS commands and examples for static NAT, PAT, etc. "Troubleshooting NAT" article - common NAT issues (like not clearing NAT translations after config changes, or forgetting ACL for NAT if needed). Might not be needed if labs go smooth, but good reading. NTP.org brief - maybe a page explaining NTP strata, but CCNA probably won't ask that. However , note NTP uses UDP 123, maybe an exam trivial. SNMP vs Syslog - an article explaining how they differ for network monitoring. QoS Basics - Cisco has a doc "IP QoS Intro" or search for "DiffServ QoS tutorial" to get the idea of what classification and PHB mean (this correlates to blueprint mentioning PHB for QoS).
- Lab 9.1: DHCP Server and Relay - Take a router (or switch) as central and two networks: e.g., Router with two LAN interfaces: one LAN has a router directly connected to PCs, another LAN maybe behind a switch. Configure one router as DHCP server for both networks (two pools). For the network where router isn't directly connected (say a router connected to another router which connects to PCs), use DHCP Relay: on that intermediate router interface, configure ip helper-address <DHCP-server-IP> . Test from PCs: they should get IPs in correct ranges along with gateway (the router) and DNS if configured. Expected Outcome: PC on each network receives valid IP config via DHCP. Use show ip dhcp binding on server to verify leases.
- Lab 9.2: NAT/PAT Configuration - Create a scenario: Router with an "inside" network (e.g., 192.168.10.0/24 with a couple PCs) and an "outside" network (simulate the internet or a stub network with a server , using, say, 203.0.113.0/24). Configure PAT on the router so that all inside addresses can share the router's outside IP. On PCs, set their gateway to the router inside IP. Test by pinging the "internet" server from a PC. It should work if NAT is correctly translating. Do show ip nat translations to see the dynamic entries (you'll see inside local, inside global, etc.). Also test something like port translation by maybe using a simulated service if possible, but ping should suffice. Optionally, configure a static NAT for one inside host (like make one PC reachable from outside on a static mapping). Try accessing it from the "outside" side. Expected Outcome: Internal PCs reach outside resources with NAT functioning, and any static NAT mapping works for inbound.
- Lab 9.3: NTP and Syslog - If you have an accessible NTP server (maybe Packet Tracer can simulate one, or use router as NTP master), configure routers to sync time. E.g., one router as NTP master (or actual public NTP if PT supports sending to an address but likely not), others as clients. Use show clock to verify time sync. For Syslog, perhaps set up one router as a syslog receiver by using a loopback as the "syslog server" (PT might not simulate an actual syslog server application, but you can at least set logging <ip> on devices). At minimum, configure logging host on a router and generate some log (like interface up/down) to see if you get a message (in PT maybe use simulation mode to see syslog packet). If not possible, conceptually ensure you know how to do it.
- Lab 9.4: SNMP (optional) - Configure a simple SNMP community on a router ( snmp-server community PUBLIC RO ) and use a PC with a network monitoring tool (PT might not have that) if not, skip actual test, just know the config.
- Lab 9.5: End-to-End Network Build - As a final project for Month 3, build a small company network: 2 departments on separate VLANs (use a switch and router-on-stick or multilayer switch for inter-VLAN), include a DHCP server for clients, use NAT on the edge router to an "ISP", run OSPF on internal routers if multiple. Also implement an ACL (access control list) as a simple firewall to allow internal to outside, but block certain port maybe (we'll do ACL more next week, but you can preview). Essentially, combine multiple technologies into one coherent network. Document the network diagram and configurations as if preparing for a handover to another engineer . Expected Outcome: A multi-faceted network that mirrors a simplified enterprise: VLANs, routing (static or OSPF), NAT for internet, DHCP for hosts, etc. This is a synthesis exercise and also good practice for the capstone next month. (Project) Documentation and Diagrams: Take one of your recent labs (like the NAT/DHCP network) and create a professional-looking network diagram using a tool (Lucidchart, draw.io, or even Packet Tracer's drawing tools). Label VLANs, IPs, device names. Write a brief network 28 documentation (couple paragraphs) describing the topology and addressing scheme. This practices the soft skill of documentation - very important for a network engineer .

## Milestones & Checkpoints
- Milestone 1: Configure a DHCP server on a router and verify clients get addresses. Show a sample client IP config (from ipconfig in PT PC or just show dhcp binding) and ensure gateway/DNS is correctly delivered. If something failed, note how you fixed it (e.g., forgot the default-router command initially).
- Milestone 2: Implement PAT and demonstrate an inside host reaching an outside host. Use show ip nat translations to present one example of a translation (e.g., 192.168.10.5:12345 -> 203.0.113.2:randomPort ). Be able to explain which is inside local/ global . If static NAT, show that outside can reach inside using the static mapping.
- Milestone 3: Set up NTP in lab or at least configure ntp server x.x.x.x on a router . Confirm time sync (maybe use debug ntp if possible or show ntp associations ). If not feasible, state the commands used and expected result.
- Milestone 4: Write down in your notes an "IP Services summary" covering DHCP (ports 67/68, DORA), NAT (terms and commands), NTP (basics of client/server), SNMP (v2c vs v3), Syslog (levels 0-7), TFTP/FTP use cases, and SSH vs Telnet difference. This is your cheat-sheet for quick recall.
- Milestone 5: Achieve 80%+ combined on the services quizzes. These are straightforward if you labbed e.g., NAT can be confusing but if you practiced, it's okay. Clarify any missed concept by re-reading that bit of Odom or using device outputs to understand.
- Checkpoint: Now the core network engineering skills are in place - you've handled network fundamentals, switching, routing, and essential services. The remaining blueprint domains are Security and Automation, which we'll cover in Month 4 and 5, along with lots of review and practice. Reflect on how many configs you can now do: from VLANs to OSPF to NAT. That's huge! Ensure all your lab files 104 29 and notes are organized - you might start revisiting them for exam review soon. Take a well-earned break and gear up for Security topics next.
