# Week 07 - Static Routing and Redundant Default Gateways

> Adapted from the "6-Month CCNA 200-301 Study Plan" reference.

## Objectives
- Configure IPv4 and IPv6 static routes, including floating routes.
- Implement HSRP or VRRP for gateway redundancy.
- Practice troubleshooting for asymmetric routing and missing routes.
- Log verification commands such as show ip route and show standby.

## Hands-On Labs & Mini Projects
- Lab 7.1 - Build a dual-router edge with static routes and backups.
- Lab 7.2 - Configure HSRP on two switches and test failover.
- Troubleshooting drill - Break a static route and document the fix.

## Milestones & Checkpoints
- Routing table snapshots stored for normal and failure states.
- HSRP state-change timeline recorded with ping evidence.
- Troubleshooting checklist refined for future routing labs.
