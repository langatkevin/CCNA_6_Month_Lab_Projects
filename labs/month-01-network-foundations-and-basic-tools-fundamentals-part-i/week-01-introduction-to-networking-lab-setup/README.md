# Week 01 - Introduction to Networking & Lab Setup

> Adapted from the "6-Month CCNA 200-301 Study Plan" reference.

## Objectives
- Review core networking terms such as LAN, WAN, bandwidth, and latency.
- Compare the OSI and TCP/IP models and trace encapsulation.
- Install Packet Tracer and confirm a two-node topology can ping.
- Create a repeatable note system for the entire program.

## Hands-On Labs & Mini Projects
- Lab 1.1 - Basic LAN ping test with two PCs and a switch.
- Lab 1.2 - Console into a 2960 switch and practice show commands.
- Mini project - Diagram the home network and label the OSI layers in use.

## Milestones & Checkpoints
- One-page explanation of how data moves between hosts using the OSI view.
- Packet Tracer screenshot plus a short summary of the ping test.
- Packet Tracer and note workflow confirmed for continued use.
