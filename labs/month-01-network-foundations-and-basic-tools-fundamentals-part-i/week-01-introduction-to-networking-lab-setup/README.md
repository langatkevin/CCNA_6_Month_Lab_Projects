# Week 01 - Introduction to Networking & Lab Setup

> Adapted from the "6-Month CCNA 200-301 Study Plan" reference.

## Objectives
- Grasp the basics of computer networks - what networks are, client/server model, the Internet structure, and common network terminology (LAN, WAN, bandwidth, latency).
- Learn about key network components and their roles: routers, switches, firewalls, access points, end devices (PCs, servers) . Be able to explain how each contributes to moving data.
- Understand the OSI 7-layer model vs TCP/IP model , and how data flows through the layers (encapsulation/de-encapsulation). Identify which layers correspond to which devices (e.g. switch = Layer 2, router = Layer 3).
- Set up your lab environment : install Cisco Packet Tracer (or alternative) and familiarize with its interface. Verify you can create a simple two-node network and ping between devices.
- Establish a note-taking and study routine: create a Notion page or notebook for Week 1 notes, and set up Anki with a few starter flashcards (e.g. OSI layers, definitions of router/switch).

## Hands-On Labs & Mini Projects
- Lab 1.1: Build Your First Network - Using Packet Tracer , create a simple network: two PCs connected by a switch. Assign IP addresses (e.g. PC1: 10.0.0.1/24, PC2: 10.0.0.2/24), and use the PT simulation mode to send a ping. Observe the encapsulation (OSI layers) in the simulation view as the ping travels . Step-by-step: Place two PC endpoints and one switch in PT, connect via copper straight-through cables, configure IP addresses on PCs, then ping. Expected outcome: PCs can ping each other successfully. Document in your notes: screenshots of your Packet Tracer topology and a brief explanation of what each device/layer did to deliver the ping.
- Lab 1.2: Exploring Packet Tracer and CLI - In Packet Tracer , add a Cisco 2960 switch and console into it from a PC (using a console cable). Practice using the Cisco CLI: enter show version , show ip interface brief . No configuration needed, just get used to CLI navigation (we'll do more in Week 2).
- (Mini-Project) Home Network Mapping: Draw a diagram of your own home network (router , Wi- Fi AP, any devices). Identify what OSI layer each component operates at and how they connect. This personalizes concepts like modem (Layer1/2), wireless router (Layer3), etc.

## Milestones & Checkpoints
- Milestone 1: Write a one-page summary or blog-style note explaining "How data moves from one computer to another over a network," referencing the OSI model. If you can teach it simply, that's a great sign of understanding.
- Milestone 2: Submit your Lab 1.1 report - e.g., a screenshot of your Packet Tracer network with a brief description of your ping results and what layers were involved. Score at least 80% on the basic networking quiz (or identify wrong answers and clarify why).
- Checkpoint: Ensure Packet Tracer is working and you're comfortable adding devices and using the simulation mode. Also verify your note-taking system (Notion/OneNote) is set up with Week 1 content neatly organized.
