# Week 02 - Network Fundamentals - Protocols and Models

> Adapted from the "6-Month CCNA 200-301 Study Plan" reference.

## Objectives
- Study Ethernet framing, TCP vs UDP behavior, and ARP resolution.
- Practice interface configuration and verification commands.
- Capture traffic in Packet Tracer simulation mode to observe headers.
- Complete short daily subnetting drills to build speed.

## Hands-On Labs & Mini Projects
- Lab 2.1 - Apply basic switch hardening (hostname, passwords, management IP).
- Lab 2.2 - Build a three-switch topology with trunks and inspect MAC tables.
- Trace exercise - Record an ARP request and reply using a packet capture.

## Milestones & Checkpoints
- Three timed subnetting drills finished with at least 90 percent accuracy.
- Short write-up describing the trunk test and MAC table observations.
- Packet capture annotated with the key header fields.
