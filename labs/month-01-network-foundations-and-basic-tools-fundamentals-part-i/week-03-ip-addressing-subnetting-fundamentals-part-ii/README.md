# Week 03 - IP Addressing & Subnetting (Fundamentals Part II)

> Adapted from the "6-Month CCNA 200-301 Study Plan" reference.

## Objectives
- Design IPv4 addressing plans with VLSM for small offices.
- Configure IPv6 global, link-local, and loopback addresses.
- Practice host configuration (PCs, switches, routers) for dual stack.
- Keep flashcards for prefix lengths, masks, and host calculations.

## Hands-On Labs & Mini Projects
- Lab 3.1 - Subnet a /24 into multiple VLANs and document the plan.
- Lab 3.2 - Configure IPv6 on two routers and verify pings plus ND output.
- Worksheet drill - Complete a set of random subnetting problems.

## Milestones & Checkpoints
- Addressing spreadsheet finished and peer-reviewed or self-checked.
- Dual-stack ping test captured with command outputs.
- Subnetting accuracy log maintained for the week.
