> Adapted from the "6-Month CCNA 200-301 Study Plan" reference.

## Objectives
- Configure VLANs, access ports, and voice ports on multiple switches.
- Practice router-on-a-stick inter-VLAN routing.
- Verify connectivity with show commands and per-VLAN pings.
- Document standard naming and IP rules for campus access layers.

## Hands-On Labs & Mini Projects
- Lab 5.1 - Create VLANs and assign access/voice ports.
- Lab 5.2 - Configure inter-VLAN routing using subinterfaces.
- Validation checklist - Record ping tests and interface summaries.

## Milestones & Checkpoints
- Access layer template documented for future labs.
- Inter-VLAN routing test evidence stored with commands and pings.
- Post-lab summary listing troubleshooting steps taken.
