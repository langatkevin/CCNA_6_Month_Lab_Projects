# Week 06 - Spanning Tree and EtherChannel (Switch Resiliency)

> Adapted from the "6-Month CCNA 200-301 Study Plan" reference.

## Objectives
- Review STP concepts (root bridge, port states, PortFast, BPDU Guard).
- Build EtherChannel links with LACP and confirm load-balancing.
- Map redundant switch topologies and expected forwarding paths.
- Record show command outputs for STP and EtherChannel verification.

## Hands-On Labs & Mini Projects
- Lab 6.1 - Configure Rapid PVST+ with a selected root bridge.
- Lab 6.2 - Build a two-switch EtherChannel and test failover.
- Observation log - Capture how STP reacts when links fail.

## Milestones & Checkpoints
- STP design notes with bridge priorities and interface roles.
- EtherChannel testing report showing port-channel status.
- Short quiz or flashcards covering key STP timers and behaviors.
