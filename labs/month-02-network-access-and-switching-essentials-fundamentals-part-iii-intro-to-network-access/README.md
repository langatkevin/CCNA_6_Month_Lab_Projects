# Month 02 - Network Access and Switching Essentials (Fundamentals Part III + Intro to Network Access)

**Focus:** Month 2 transitions from pure theory into more hands-on switching and network access topics. We'll cover the CCNA Network Access domain (VLANs, STP, EtherChannel, wireless LANs in more depth) and finish any remaining fundamentals (like ARP, DHCP basics) as they tie in. By the end of Month 2, you'll have configured VLANs, understood how switches prevent loops with STP, and set up a basic wireless LAN. We'll also continue practicing subnetting and introduce more troubleshooting and design thinking. Domains covered: Network Access (CCNA domain 2.0) in-depth, plus relevant IP Services basics (DHCP, ARP) and revisit Network Fundamentals concepts in practice.
